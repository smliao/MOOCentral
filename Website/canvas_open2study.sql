As we examine their lives and work we will explore aspects of the food world ranging from restaurant criticism to food writing looking in particular at cookbooks magazines and newspapers. Each unit focuses on one of the six innovators and draws on panel discussions and interviews with food writers researchers and practitioners who knew or worked with them. During the six weeks you will interact with other students and an instructor contribute to a blog and share your writing and images. You will also have the option to submit your own research and reflections to the New School Web magazine The Inquisitive Eater a forum for food lovers professionals artists and academics to discuss the role of food in our lives and its impact on the environment politics economics nationalism poverty inequality and family. We hope this course will encourage you to deepen your exploration of food. With this in mind we have provided a space for you to discuss your ideas practice and improve your investigative and analytical skills and experiment with your ability to communicate through word and image. As we noted in Innovators of American Cuisine 1 we do not aim to create a canon by identifying a set of founding fathers and mothers but rather to draw attention to the cultural and social dynamics that have brought American cuisine to its present flourishing and popularity. We invite you to look beyond current trends and celebrities to reflect on the contributions of these luminaries to the history of U.S. culinary arts.

Each unit focuses on one of the four innovators drawing on panel discussions and interviews with food writers researchers and practitioners who knew them. Structured around notable figures we refer to as “culinary luminaries” the course leans toward the past. This is not because we intend to create a canon establishing the most important contributors to the development of the food world in the U.S. Much research is developing in the field of culinary arts which is emerging as a field worthy of attention not only from journalists and practitioners but from authors and scholars. We could not fully understand the contributions of our four innovators without looking at the social and cultural contexts of their work. The video material dedicated to each of the four innovators will delve into these topics shedding light on distinctive aspects of the U.S. food world at different points in time. Julia Child James Beard Judith Jones and Henri Soulé worked in fields ranging from media to catering and from restaurants to publishing. Their diverse contributions hint at the complex dynamics that lead to the evolution of the food world a world influenced by food producers restaurateurs marketers opinion makers food writers and book editors to mention just a few. Why does the course focus on past innovators rather than contemporary trends Today’s culinary world is so dominated by the media and their news cycles that we tend to live in a compressed present always looking for the next hot thing and creating celebrities to fuel the self-perpetuation of the industry. We seldom take the time to pause and look back.
