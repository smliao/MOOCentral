Our media environment is increasingly saturated with data, including large collections of leaked documents published by Wikileaks, public databases about lobbying or government spending, and “big data” from social networks such as Twitter and Facebook. As a result, many media organisations seek data-savvy journalists to help them process this information to understand what is in it, to identify what is important, and to provide insights to readers in a compelling way.  Modules: 1. Data journalism in the newsroom, with instructor Simon Rogers 2. Finding data to support stories, with instructor Paul Bradshaw 3.

As we examine their lives and work, we will explore aspects of the food world ranging from restaurant criticism to food writing, looking in particular at cookbooks, magazines, and newspapers. Each unit focuses on one of the six innovators and draws on panel discussions and interviews with food writers, researchers, and practitioners who knew or worked with them. During the six weeks, you will interact with other students and an instructor, contribute to a blog, and share your writing and images. You will also have the option to submit your own research and reflections to the New School Web magazine, The Inquisitive Eater, a forum for food lovers, professionals, artists, and academics to discuss the role of food in our lives, and its impact on the environment, politics, economics, nationalism, poverty, inequality, and family. We hope this course will encourage you to deepen your exploration of food. With this in mind, we have provided a space for you to discuss your ideas, practice and improve your investigative and analytical skills, and experiment with your ability to communicate through word and image. As we noted in Innovators of American Cuisine 1, we do not aim to create a canon by identifying a set of founding fathers and mothers, but rather to draw attention to the cultural and social dynamics that have brought American cuisine to its present flourishing and popularity. We invite you to look beyond current trends and celebrities to reflect on the contributions of these luminaries to the history of U.S. culinary arts. We do not intend to set U.S. culinary arts as a model.

Students often take these placement exams with minimal preparation or after a long break since their last math class. The study materials in the course will help students prepare for placement exams, and higher scores mean fewer required math courses in college. Students who have already taken a placement exam (such as the ACT) can also use these materials to study and then retest, hopefully scoring higher. College students who have started, but not finished their math courses, can also retake a placement exam and possibly skip a math class. The course will also be valuable for anyone who just wants to refresh their math skills. The provided study materials are individualized based on a student’s current knowledge. Each student will be provided a customized learning path that maximizes efficiency so that study time is spent where it’s needed most. Beyond math content, the course will also provide college success material such as test-taking strategies, new student orientation, and study techniques.

Some are well-known to the public, others less so, but they all have left a long-lasting mark on what and where Americans eat, how they cook, and even the way they think and talk about food. Each unit focuses on one of the four innovators, drawing on panel discussions and interviews with food writers, researchers, and practitioners who knew them. Structured around notable figures we refer to as “culinary luminaries,” the course leans toward the past. This is not because we intend to create a canon establishing the most important contributors to the development of the food world in the U.S. Much research is developing in the field of culinary arts, which is emerging as a field worthy of attention not only from journalists and practitioners, but from authors and scholars. We could not fully understand the contributions of our four innovators without looking at the social and cultural contexts of their work. The video material dedicated to each of the four innovators will delve into these topics, shedding light on distinctive aspects of the U.S. food world at different points in time. Julia Child, James Beard, Judith Jones, and Henri Soulé worked in fields ranging from media to catering, and from restaurants to publishing. Their diverse contributions hint at the complex dynamics that lead to the evolution of the food world, a world influenced by food producers, restaurateurs, marketers, opinion makers, food writers, and book editors, to mention just a few. Why does the course focus on past innovators, rather than contemporary trends? Today’s culinary world is so dominated by the media and their news cycles that we tend to live in a compressed present, always looking for the next hot thing and creating celebrities to fuel the self-perpetuation of the industry. We seldom take the time to pause and look back. How did we get here? Was it always like this? America’s relationship with food is particularly interesting because many feel that until the late 1950s the high-end culinary world of the U.S. lived as a reflection of French haute cuisine and its approach to restaurants. What happened in that period that generated radical changes in the way Americans eat out and think of what constitutes good food? We do not intend to set U.S. culinary arts as a model. Through the close examination of the American experience and the contributions of innovators to its gastronomy, we want to help you acquire critical tools you can adapt and use to explore your own food culture, wherever you are. This is an open and burgeoning field with much to observe and learn about.

Documents are no longer written and published as individual entities within a documentation set but rather written as data segments for reuse on systems that automate processes for controlling and managing the segments. Information is no longer published as a document solely for paper ouput, but for electronic access on PCs, cell phones, and other handheld devices. This means that the technical writer today must be familiar with the solutions that employ the features of structured writing for reuse, and the latest standard approaches for segmenting and storing information for output to multiple types of formats and access on different devices. The course is designed to further your technical writing skills with use of XMetaL, XML, and the DITA standard. It also introduces you to other writing standards, output options, and content management systems. Basic knowledge of writing standards, output options, and content management systems is helpful.

Expect to view approx. 80 minutes of lectures per week which sums up to altogether 5 hours per week incl. self-study time. > mooc@macromedia.de Originating in the Design Department of MHMK, Macromedia University of Applied Sciences in Munich, the Macromedia MOOC Design Thinking is emphasizing the rewarding link between management and creativity. To us, managing creativity means drawing on various findings and multidiscliplinary methods, yet guiding them through standardized and verifiable management procedures. Besides Design and Art history, the background of our MOOC team therefore ranges from business, psychology and human resource to transmedia, visualization, narration, and journalism, for instance. We will thus be able to discuss Design Thinking from various perspectives. Our MOOC will help you answer the following questions:  1. What is Design Thinking? Which benefits may I expect when implementing it as a management strategy?  2. How can innovation be systematically triggered ?  How can I implement Design Thinking into my own projects? 3. Talking about the potential of Design Thinking – what kind of best practices are there ?  4. What kind of team do I need to in order to initialize a Design Thinking process? No prior knowledge of Design Thinking is needed in order to attend the MOOC.  Interest in creative techniques, innovation and management is welcome. - You don''t know what human centered design, strategic design or participatory innovation culture is? - Great, you''ll learn it here. - You are a business development specialist? - Great, we hope to inspire you. Please feel free to help us inspire others by sharing interesting links, events and projects on our Facebook page.  We would be happy to keep you posted!  Become a friend and follow the conversation!

A course for students of economics, business studies, mathematics, physics and computer science.', 'In this course you will simulate the time evolution of prices of financial assets, use the Black-Scholes model to price European or Asian options and compute the Value-at-Risk of a portfolio. The approach is hands-on with a strong emphasis on practical simulations that you will program, run and explore in your own computer. "Monte Carlo Methods in Finance" will be offered on iversity from 20 January, 2014 until 16 April, 2014. The course is structured in 9 chapters Chapter 1: Introduction [2014/01/20 - 2014/01/29] Chapter 2: Understanding random numbers [2014/01/30 - 2014/02/05] Chapter 3: Generating random numbers [2014/02/06 - 2014/02/12] Chapter 4: Brownian motion [2014/02/13 - 2014/02/26] Chapter 5: Ordinary differential equations [2014/02/27 - 2014/03/05] Chapter 6: Stochastic differential equations [2014/03/06 - 2014/03/12] Chapter 7: Pricing of simple derivative products [2014/03/13 - 2014/03/26] Chapter 8: Pricing of more complex derivative products [2014/03/27 - 2014/04/02] Chapter 9: Modeling and quantifying financial risk [2014/04/03 - 2014/04/16] Chapters are divided into units. Each unit consists of a video followed by a quiz. At the end of each chapter you will solve and turn in some homework exercises. In these exercises you will explore additional material on your own and then respond to questions in multiple choice format. Some of the explanations in the videos and the exercises make reference to short programs that you can download and execute in your own computer. You are encouraged to experiment with these programs (modify the values of parameters, complete or rewrite the code to alter the model or to implement related functionality) and run your own simulations. The code provided can be executed in either GNU Octave or MATLAB. You will receive a certificate of participation after having completed at least 75% of the course learning activities (videos, quizzes and homework). At the end of this course you will know how to answer the following questions: You will need between 5 and 8 hours of work per week during a total of 12 weeks to complete all the learning activities, including the homework. The course is geared to students not only in economics and finance, but also in mathematics, computer science, engineering, physics and the natural sciences. No knowledge of finance is required. Basic knowledge of Calculus (integration and differentiation, Taylor series), Linear Algebra (matrices, determinants, eigenvalues and eigenvectors) and Probability (random variables, probability density and cumulative distribution functions) at an introductory undergraduate level is strongly recommended. Programming knowledge is recommended. We will be designing simulations that can be executed in either GNU Octave or in Matlab. The programs will be short, intuitive, fully documented and easy to follow. Yet they will be powerful tools under your control, and will allow you to explore, experiment and learn at your own initiative. The course will be taught in English.

In this course, we will design resilient schools that could serve as community centers and shelters for the victims of the devastating typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines.', 'On November 9, 2013 the devastating typhoon Haiyan hit the Phillipines, causing more than 5,000 deaths and destroying the homes and cities for millions. Natural disasters are happening more and more often due to climate change. We can’t do much to stop them, but as architects we can help with the recovery and to build shelters that would withstand them. The goal of this online course is to generate design ideas for resilient schools for the victims of Typhoon Haiyan and other natural disasters. The participants in this course will design schools, which could be implemented by the Department of Education and Architecture for Humanity in the Philippines. We will engage with a team of architects, planners, engineers, and social workers. After the course, the projects and instructions will be placed on the open source platform Open Online Architecture (OOArch.org), so anyone can download and use them. An international jury will select the best projects, which will eventually be built. We’ll have weekly lectures and daily discussions on our forum. A team of professors, consultants, and teaching assistants led by Prof. Ivan Shumkov will guide and assist all students in their work.

They will improve their design and collaboration skills. During the second week of the course, each student will design individual proposals and post them on the forum. All students will be publish their design proposals and ask others for feedback and help on their projects. They will form collaboration teams, which will work together on developing integral projects that include aspects of architectural design, engineering, social space, community development, economical feasibility, sustainability and resilience. The involvement in the course is flexible. For architects, this is meant to be an intensive design studio course, so participants are expected to dedicate 10-20 hours a week. For others, who act as advisors and collaborators, it could take 2-5 hours of work weekly. The course will be organized similar to a competition for design ideas, but will encourage collaborations and teamwork. We will use peer-to-peer review as a way to exchange feedback. We will also have a course forum and team groups on Google+ where students will exchange and discuss design ideas. During the course, the projects will be developed to the phase of schematic design. At the end of the course, the 5-10 best proposals will be selected and further developed with the guidance of the course professor, consultants, and the local authorities. Some of the proposals will eventually be build if funding and local support are secured. Previous experience in design is recommended, but there will be opportunities for others to participate. The course work will be collaboration between people from many different backgrounds: design, engineering, economics, healthcare, social studies. They will share and exchange their knowledge, skills and energy to design solutions that are resilient, feasible, sustainable, buildable, etc. Nestor Arabejos, Ecotektonika, Manila Bea Camacho, Harvard GSD, Philippines Xavier Vilalta, XVA Arquitectura, Barcelona Kenneth Frampton, Columbia University, New York Giancarlo Mazzanti, El Equipo de Mazzanti, Bogota Illac Angelo Diaz, Architecture for Humanity, Manila Ivan Shumkov, Open Online Academy, New York Others TBD After completing the course assignments, students will receive a letter of participation according to their role and degree of involvement: architect, designer, project manager, engineer, consultant, advisor, economist, communications, etc. Students who submit the final Resilient School project will be eligible for the official certificate of successful completion of the course.

Based on the recent public debate on data protection and massive privacy infringements, this course will explore the connection between cyber security and human rights.', '“For the internet to remain global and open, it is imperative that countries, including those currently lacking capacity to adequately deal with security concerns, to adopt a growth- and freedom-oriented, participative, bottom-up perspective on security that has human rights at its core.” (Joint Governmental Statement at UN Human Rights Council in June 2013) Arguably, the internet poses severe challenges to state sovereignty and governmental legitimacy. Governments around the world find it increasingly difficult to control, regulate or monitor the massive flow of data within the cyber-world and uphold human rights and fundamental freedoms at the same time. Nevertheless, the world wide web is one of the main prerequisites for economic growth and democracy. It enables citizen participation , engagements and inter-action on all levels that can lead to social transformation and political change. Radical groups, democracy movements, development organizations and human rights NGOs all use the internet to further their goals. Since the former NSA contractor, Edward Snowden, released a variety of confidential documents we all know of PRISM, TEMPORA and other programs and their massive privacy infringements. These programs were primarily designed to collect user data to increase the capability of intelligence services to protect societies from internal and external threats. But are those programs not undermining essential citizen freedoms and fundamental human rights? This course systematically examines the compliance between international human rights norms, standards and mechanism within legal and political frameworks and the growing cyber security regime. Debates about the loss of state sovereignty over cyber security, paired with the idea of internet freedom and users’ and citizens’ responsibility lead to the question, whether individual and state responsibility based on reciprocity and human rights compliance are reconcilable. Students taking this course will learn: • how human rights are used in the debate about Public Privacy • how individual, societal, political and governmental actors interact in this context • what cyber security in consistency with human rights is about. Using this information, students will practice assessing and analyzing cyber security issues based on international human rights norms, standards and regimes. The first part of the course will provide an overview of the current state of international and regional human rights regimes and their efforts to protect freedom rights while also ensuring private security. The second part will then go into the evolution of human rights, their violations and protection mechanism in era of the internet.

Things, people and places we all know about. To discover more about the Design 101 mindset, you can follow our course preparation on Facebook, Twitter and YouTube. It would be nice to receive your feedback! Design 101 is a journey into contemporary design in which you will transform yourself and your everyday life into 101 projects. For three months, you will develop basic design attitudes that will allow you to thrive in today’s world, while restoring your understanding of its mechanics. We live in a global community where the physical bits are slowly (and not so slowly) overlapped by social media. Design has become #design. Indeed, the use of new technologies has changed the teaching and, by the same token, the nature of the past; the past is being renewed. Herein lies the conceptual hinge of Design 101: a new way to learn a new design. To do so, we will collectively explore the tools of today (such as this MOOC platform) to step into a fantastic voyage through time and space, in which we are all absolute beginners. Design is everything. Design is objects, buildings, sports, games…our lives. Johan Cruyff, a very famous footballer and fantastic designer, once said: “I never practice tricks. I play very simply. That''s what it''s all about. Playing simple football is the hardest thing.” very simply Everyday, you will receive a special package from a different place along our journey.

From 15 minutes to one hour of work per day at the most. The quicker, the better! On Mondays, you get an overview of the week and a quiz to complete. Then, following our input, you start working. By Sunday, you will upload images of what you made during the week. You will refer, think and create a lot of different things. Not easy, but surely fun! Our special trip will end with a three-day festival: a special event in a special place to exhibit your work to the public and get to know your travel mates. forum: questions and answers Doubts, ideas, whatever comes to mind. It is a perfect place to get entangled into discussions and become a true actor within the community. In the design world, questions are much more interesting than answers. This is why the best questions asked in this forum will be redirected to a Design 101 e-book, to be printed at the end of the course. extra! extra! encyclopedia! If you are of the curious kind, we have a special page with all the people, places, things mentioned throughout the course. We could consider it our mini-encyclopedia. Once we have a shared vocabulary/language, things become meaningful. Conversations start up quickly and flow nicely. Like any other language, “design” is in constant change. Our mini-encyclopedia is a great foundation upon which to build your own collection of references. The course will officially start on October 28, 2013 and end on February 5, 2014. However, the course will remain "open" until April 20, 2014 (to give you more time to complete the homework). The various things to do (so-called “hands-on” activities) will be divided into 14 units, one per week. Design 101 will help you understand: No prior knowledge is required. If you have a lot of prior knowledge, it might make the learning process more difficult, but don’t worry, no one is perfect.

We traced the development of architecture since the 1990s by discussing some of the most important topics and influential architects of our time.', 'Our course will analyze major contemporary architectural ideas, ideologies, and projects in the context of both globalization and specific local contexts. We will trace the development of architecture since the early 90s by discussing the work of some of the most influential architects of our time. The critical reflection on contemporary topics will allow students to better understand the buildings and cities which we live in. When talking about the architectural protagonists of today, we will focus on their most recent work. Some references will be made to their earlier work, but the focus will be on how they adapt their thinking to current design tendencies. We will examine the evolution of their work and at the same time try to understand how they react to current challenges and opportunities in our profession and society. The course will offer Virtual Classroom videoconference every Friday at 10am NYC time (4pm CET). Students will do research and critical analysis of architecture. They will analyze and comment on the projects presented in each chapter of the course. They will also explore buildings in the cities where they live and visit, according to the concepts introduced in the course, by taking pictures and making videos. The work will be posted every week on the course forum and discussed with others. A selection of the best projects and posts will be featured in an exhibit after completing the course. The course will introduce participants to the contemporary architecture scene and allow them to position themselves into it. Students will acquire the essential skills for looking at, analyzing and understanding architecture. The final goal is to turn use architecture as a way to look at the places that we inhabit, an action for positive change, and a generator of a vision for making possible worlds. The course is both for the general public and for people with experience in architecture, so any person can take it. Basic knowledge of architecture is recommended but not necessary. If you are already a student of architecture, this would be a way to expand and further your studies in a global context. If you are already an architect you can learn about the recent developments of the profession and be inspired for your work. if you have general cultural curiosity about architecture, this course will introduce you to some basic concepts that would allow you to understand better the values and importance of architecture. Living in the world of architecture is a full-time job, but you’ll have to spend 2-3 hours per week with your computer and a few more exploring your city. The final assignment will take a few days to complete if you want to qualify for the exposition. You will receive a certificate for the course after you complete all the assignments.

(120, 'Political Philosophy: An Introduction', 'Are you interested in politics? Do you feel the need to have a clearer understanding of it, beyond the conventional language of media and social networks? Well, this course might provide the help and the stimulus you are looking for.', 'This course is designed as a vocabulary of the main terms used by all of us when talking about local as well as world politics; terms which we often use without a proper awareness of their meanings and connections, a circumstance not exactly helpful to any attempt at understanding how politics really works, regardless of our wishful thinking or simplistic morality or easy cynicism. Now, if we want to get deeper into the workings of politics - the only serious starting point for those who want to reform it - we must agree to begin with very abstract notions, that is with the general definitions of what politics, conflict, power (incl. force/violence), and what legitimate power mean (Part 1: What is Politics?). On these premises we will then explain the still main political institution, the state, and peer into the dynamics of war and peace that has dominated the relationships between the states (Part 2: How Does Politics Work?). Since with economic globalization, which has restricted the room for political action, things are getting much more complicated on the planet, and more challenging outside of it (man-made climate change starts in the atmosphere), classical notions have to be rethought. The very nature of the threats endangering our global commons does not leave the definition of politics (Part 3: World Politics and the Future). This course does not aim at communicating any ''message'' as to how politics ought to be, but it will obviously try to clarify the main concepts - freedom, equality, justice - we make use of while talking about values and principles in politics; this is what is called ''normative political philosophy'' and is regarded here as an important chapter of political philosophy, not the whole of it (Part 4: Ethics and Politics). At the end of the course you may have achieved a clearer and less confused awareness of the political vocabulary, thus gaining a more complex, more autonomous and more critical understanding of political processes. If you are a student of political science, law, sociology and economics you may get better tools for catching the overarching sense of processes that you do otherwise approach in a fragmented perspective. My teaching method aims primarily at defining and discussing concepts, not at illustrating authors or providing historical narratives; needless to say, there will be enough reference to authors, books, events and processes, in particular with regard to the evolution of political modernity. For each of the twelve lectures of about 30-40'', which will be presented in shorter units, you may need three more hours of homework to do additional readings and - more importantly - to perform additional reflection. For most of the notions discussed in the course I will suggest readings consisting of both classical authors and recent literature. For each lecture I will reply to up to five requests of clarification or critical assessments (all this exclusively via the iversity platform). From time to time you will have the opportunity to test your acquisition of fresh knowledge by responding to multiple-choice-tests. At the end of the course you may want to take a final exam, whose format will be announced later. Letter-grading from 1 to 5 will be used. There will be unfortunately no textbook. The textbooks available in English are all, though in various ways, different from my approach and my contents. My slides will serve as a textbook in a nutshell. Due to my conceptual approach, to follow this course you do not need a prior knowledge of philosophy or political science, just the degree of general culture needed to pass the final high school exam, be it Abitur, maturità, baccalauréat or 高考(gao kao).

Do you want to know how stories are told? Do you want to analyze, understand, contextualize and create stories and narratives? Then join our MOOC and share our passion for storytelling! Together with a whole network of media researchers, creators and students we will: - learn storytelling basics such as antagonist/protagonist relationships, narrative/narrated time, ... - have a look at exciting current media projects - analyze how they are designed and executed based on aforementioned basics - and discuss how (and if) new online tools and formats change the way stories are told and perceived. The 8-chapter course starts on October 25th, 2013 and ends on December 20th, 2013. (Please review the updated FAQ below in case you have questions.) It offers weekly video material, lessons, interviews and tasks on the following topics (not necessarily in this order): - storytelling basics - serial formats (on the TV, web and beyond) - storytelling in role-playing games - interactive storytelling in video games - transmedia storytelling - alternate-reality gaming - augmented reality and location-based storytelling - the role of tools, interfaces and information architectures in current storytelling. Our first Storytelling-MOOC will focus on fictional formats. Our goal is to inspire and help understand. To broaden our horizon of what is and might be possible and what has already been attempted, and what has succeeded or even failed - and why. In several little tasks you''ll analyze and practice storytelling on your own and in teams. Based at the Design Department at the University of Applied Sciences Potsdam, this MOOC is not only interdisciplinary, but also includes guest lectures and project presentations by game designers, writers, transmedia producers, TV makers, executives and theorists from many different fields of study. We will thus be able to discuss content, structures and technologies from various perspectives. Our MOOC will help you answer the following questions: 1. How do fictional stories work? Which structures and mechanics are used? 2. How do new technologies influence the ways stories are told and perceived - and which new media formats have been developed during the last years? 3. How can technologies, interfaces and visuals engage an audience fast and continuously? 4. How can I develop and implement my own story-ideas - on my own or in teams? No prior knowledge of storytelling mechanics is needed, but can be helpful. Interest in creative processes and new technologies is welcome and encouraged. - You don''t know what an alternate-reality game, RPG or transmedia storytelling is? - Great, you''ll learn it here. - You are a storytelling professional? - Great, we hope to inspire you.

Our MOOC is free of charge for anyone interested worldwide. However, how much of your free time you invest is up to you. When did this course start? This MOOC started on October 25th, 2013 and ran for eight weeks until December 20th, 2013. All video material will be available for another year for those enrolled prior to the course closing date on December 20th, however, the StoryMOOC team will not be consistently present on the discussions boards after December 20th. Can I still enroll? No, unfortunately enrollments were only possible until December 20th. All content will be available here for those enrolled for at least 1 year. Is there any other chance to get to the content of this course? Yes, all video lectures and interviews are to be uploaded on our YouTube-Channel http://www.youtube.com/user/officialStoryMOOC for those who couldn''t follow the course on iversity in time. Will there be certificates? YES! Statements of Participation will be available from Friday, Feb 21st onwards for any participant who has completed the course by 80% or more. This means: - if you already gathered more than 80%: Congratulations! In this case you have earned your Statement of Participation for the MOOC already, and can download it on Friday (or later) from the iversity course website (once logged in). - if you have not finished the course yet: Don’t worry, you still have time to go through all the videos, quizzes,... thoroughly until at least December 2014, and download your Statement of Participation once you’re done. What does MOOC stand for? It means "Massive Open Online Course". What does this course consist of? The course is based on recorded video lectures, quizzes and creative tasks that will be online from October 25th here on our course website on http://iversity.org/courses/the-future-of-storytelling. From October 25th onwards, a new video lecture will be launched every Friday for 8 weeks at 10am CET. If you''re enrolled this means: you''ll be able to access the videos from then on for at least the 8 following weeks, not just at 10am. How much time will I need to participate? From just watching the video lessons (about 20-60 min per week) to engaging in discussions and tasks (about 2-4 hours per week), exploring our reading list and even presenting your own current projects via essays or video link on our Facebook page, your involvement is entirely up to you. The more you engage yourself, the more you gain. Will there be graded assignments? There is weekly homework (Creative Tasks) that you are very well invited but not obliged to do to complete this course. There will be no graded/peer-graded assessments/exams. Our aim is to inspire, give input and offer a stage to discuss and work together with many others who share the passion for storytelling. So: What you make out of it, how much you get involved, is up to you. Is this course only available in English? Yes, for now. Due to technical and production time restrictions, we will only be able to offer this first MOOC in ONE language. As English is the language most applying students here share, we decided to go for it. However, we uploaded our videos on our YouTube channel http://www.youtube.com/user/officialStoryMOOC, were they can be subtitled using AMARA. My written English is not that good. Can I still participate in the tasks? Of course! Although language is an important part of storytelling in general, great works have been created without even a single audible word (e.g. silent movies). We are working on making our tasks as language-independent as possible. Good grammar and spelling skills are not the only key to succeeding in this course. How much time do I have to complete the tasks? Most tasks are designed to help you experiment with storytelling. They are useful for YOU whenever you do them. To make them count for the course, however, tasks given usually can be worked on for a week and they are due the following Friday, again 10am CET. How can I connect with other students? You can visit our Facebook-Page https://www.facebook.com/TheFutureOfStorytellingMooc (no FB-account necessary to read and see all posts) and/or use #storymooc at Twitter to connect with other StoryMOOCers. Also: Feel free to create your own meeting spots/blogs (that you are most comfortable with) if you want. Will there be a second edition/run of this course? Not for now. Although we would love to create and host a so-to-speak "2nd season" of this MOOC, there are no definite plans yet. This experience will therefore be unique for now. What do I do if I have questions that are not answered here? If you have technical questions concerning the iversity-platform/enrollments, please have a look at the FAQ. If you have any more questions concerning the content of our course or great ideas you want to share: You can always post on our Facebook-Page and ask the community in case our team is not available.

Marketing beschränkt sich somit nicht nur auf die Bereiche Verkauf und Werbung, sondern umfasst eine Vielzahl an Aktivitäten, u.a. die systematische Informationsgewinnung über Märkte oder die Gestaltung des Produktangebots, die Preissetzung, die Kommunikation und den Vertrieb. Aus unternehmensinterner Sicht müssen außerdem die Voraussetzungen geschaffen werden, damit marktbezogene Aktivitäten effizient umgesetzt werden können: Dies wird insbesondere durch die Führung des gesamten Unternehmens nach der Leitidee der Marktorientierung erreicht. Marketing wird folglich auch als gedankliche Leitlinie für unternehmerische Entscheidungen verstanden und stellt eine zentrale betriebswirtschaftliche Funktion innerhalb eines marktorientierten Unternehmens dar. Für diesen Kurs ist kein Vorwissen erforderlich. Für das Teilnahme-Zertifikat müssen für die Kursaktivitäten ca. 3 Stunden pro Woche eingeplant werden, für das 5-Credit-Point-Äquivalent sind ca. 15-20 Stunden pro Woche notwendig. Informationen zur Anmeldung zum Multiple Choice Examen und der Präsenzprüfungen sowie der jeweiligen Gebühr werden bei Kursbeginn bekannt gegeben.

Sei Kiebitz, Anpacker oder Formalisierer: Du hast die Wahl!', 'Mathematik: das ist Freude am Denken! Und mathematisch denken kann jeder! Wer an diesem Kurs teilnimmt, erhält seine regelmäßige Dosis an meditativen Denkaufgaben, spannenden Knobeleien und mathematischen Einsichten. In den Inhaltsgebieten Arithmetik und Geometrie werden mathematische Denk- und Arbeitsweisen vermittelt, beispielsweise Problemlösen, Begriffe definieren und Sätze finden und beweisen. Im ersten Kursblock werden wir uns mit folgenden Fragen befassen: Wie definiert man mathematische Begriffe? Wie findet man eigentlich mathematische Gesetzmäßigkeiten? Und wie beweist man diese? Welche Rolle spielen Annahmen in der Mathematik? Wie baut sich das Gebäude der Mathematik aus Definitionen, Annahmen und Gesetzmäßgikeiten auf? Fragen über Fragen, denen wir uns mit zahlreichen Experimenten widmen. Im zweiten Kursblock werden wir die Denk- und Arbeitsweisen aus dem ersten Block in verschiedenen Gebieten anwenden und dadurch festigen. In der Geometrie werden wir uns mit der Tätigkeit des Messens und dem Abstandsbegriff, mit Strecken, Halbgeraden und Geraden, mit Ebenen und Halbenenen und mit Winkeln befassen. In der Arithmetik schauen wir uns den Begriff der Teilbarkeit näher an, veranschaulichen Begriffe wie "größter gemeinsamer Teiler" und "kleinstes gemeinsames Vielfaches", untersuchen Primzahlen und Primfaktorzerlegungen und experimentieren mit Stellenwertsystemen. Im dritten Kursblock befassen wir uns mit grundlegenden mathematischen Konzepten: Was sind Mengen, Relationen und Funktionen? Auch hier werden wir uns den Begriffen und ihren Zusammenhängen mit grundlegenden mathematischen Denk- und Arbeitsweisen nähern. Experimentieren, erforschen, untersuchen, ergründen, Vermutungen anstellen, Vermutungen verwerfen, Vermutungen beweisen. Im vierten und letzten Kursblock machen wir uns noch einmal an zentrale Gesetzmäßigkeiten der Mathematik. Wie findet man solche Gesetzmäßgikeiten, und wie beweist man sie? In der Geometrie schauen wir uns schicke Sätze am Kreis an, in der Arithmetik nicht weniger schicke Sätze der Zahlentheorie. Mathematik pur, Mathematik anschaulich, Mathematik handgemacht. Jede/r kann mitmachen, der mathematische Vorkenntnisse aus dem Gymnasium mitbringt. Und wenn Du nicht auf dem Gymnasium warst, aber gerne mitmachen möchtest: Dann trau dich! Man sollte natürlich schon mal mit Geometrie und Algebra zu tun gehabt haben. Vieles wird dann wieder aufgefrischt, denn wir machen dann nicht auf dem Niveau der 12. oder 13. Klasse weiter, sondern bauen die Teilgebiete, in denen wir arbeiten, noch einmal grundlegend auf. Oberstufenwissen zu Analysis und Linearer Algebra ist nicht notwendig! Du kannst dich entscheiden, wie aktiv Du dich in den Kurs einbringen möchtest - je nach Interesse und Ehrgeiz! 1) Kiebitze wollen "nur mal gucken" oder mit dem mathematischen Denken erst einmal warm werden. Kiebitze schnuppern jede Woche in den Kurs, schauen sich eins, zwei Videos an und stöbern vielleicht einmal in den weiterführenden Bereichen. Hierdurch bekommen sie einen Einblick, was mathematisches Denken bedeutet, und sie erhalten Impulse, wo man Mathematik auch im Alltag findet und gebrauchen kann. Vielleicht bekommen sie dabei sogar Lust auf mehr! Aufwand: ca. 1-2 Stunden pro Woche 2) Anpacker legen Hand an und erforschen aktiv Mathematik, haben aber keine rechte Lust auf zu viele Formeln. Für Anpacker heißt es: Ärmel hochkrempeln! Im MOOC lernen sie, wie man mathematische Situationen systematisch erforscht, wie man anschauliche Begründungen für mathematische Gesetzmäßgikeiten finden kann, und sie erhalten einen Einblick darin, wie man Abstraktes konkretisiert (und umgekehrt). Sie entwickeln ihre Vorstellungskraft zur Lösung mathematischer Probleme weiter und lernen, Vermutungen anhand konkreter Modelle zu untersuchen. Aufwand: ca. 3-4 Stunden pro Woche 3) Formalisierer geben sich mit der Anschauung nicht zufrieden - sie wollen Formeln sehen! Formalisierer sind Anpacker, die zusätzlich auch noch das Spiel mit abstrakter Symbolsprache lieben. Sie lernen, formale Definitionen zu fassen und formale Beweise zu führen. Natürlich immer basierend auf tragfähigen Vorstellungen, die sie mit den Anpackern teilen! Aufwand: ca. 7-8 Stunden pro Woche Du möchtest ein Kiebitz in der Arithmetik sein, aber ein Anpacker in der Geometrie? Oder ein Formalisierer in der Arithmetik, aber ein Kiebitz in der Geometrie? Kein Problem - alles ist möglich! So kannst Du deinen individuellen Aufwand selbst wählen und dir diejenigen Inhalte zusammenstellen, die dich interessieren. Du erhältst eine Teilnahmebestätigung, wenn du aktiv mitmachst. Wie das genau geht, wird in der ersten Woche erklärt.

(174, 'Creative coding', 'This course introduces computer programming as a creative discipline to generate sounds, images, animation and more.', '(Image © 2010 Jon McCormack) Learning to program is no longer just for computer specialists and software developers. People from many different backgrounds now want to understand the basics of programming, because it’s both fun and an increasingly valuable skill. One of the most exciting ways to learn programming is through authoring your own creative programs. Known as “creative coding”, this growing field uses computer software as a medium to develop original creative expression. So if you’re an artist, designer, architect or musician who’s interested in how you can expand your creative skills, or even a computer programmer looking to work in creative applications, you will find this course extremely useful. Throughout the course we’ll help you develop practical programming concepts and skills by exploring creative ideas and challenges. We’ll be looking at the history and philosophy behind artistic uses of technology, so you can gain a greater understanding of how best to express your own creative vision using the software you write. The aim is to teach you “algorithmic thinking” – ways to conceptualise and model the world so you can express creative ideas using computer programs. A background in programming is not assumed or necessary. Each week we will start with a simple creative idea and guide you through turning that idea into a working computer program. We’ll be exploring programs that can generate images, animations and sound and you’ll learn how you can interact with them to change their behaviour. As you’ll discover, this opens a world of possibilities, because as you expand and modify your program new creative possibilities emerge. Starting with simple processes we will look at how to create increasingly complex and nuanced visual and sonic artworks using generative programming techniques. Assignments will give you the opportunity to explore your own creative ideas and share your achievements with fellow students. We will also look at how a number of leading professional artists and designers work creatively with computers, technology and robotics, examining their creative process and the ideas that inspire them. The course is very different from technical courses on programming. We will place creative programming in context through discussion about some of the most interesting questions raised by computer-generated art, such as: Can a computer be independently creative? Who is the author of a work of computer art: the programmer or the program? How is our understanding of art and creativity changed by technology? Does the computer bring anything that is really new to art? If you’ve ever wondered about these questions or wanted to learn how to program a computer for creative purposes, then this course is for you.', 'https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/creative-coding', 'http://view.vzaar.com/1569932/player', '2014-06-02', 6, 'https://ugc.futurelearn.com/uploads/images/37/29/regular_37297071-1b97-4aab-b6c9-452fe6ad7648.jpg', 'N/A', 'FutureLearn', 0, 'N/A', 'no', 'Monash University', '2014-05-18 22:39:41'),

We’re going to travel on a historical journey through literature, visiting notable country houses around Yorkshire and Derbyshire. You’ll gain insight into life in these country houses and will learn about some common misconceptions. You will see the magnificent seventeenth-century wall paintings at Bolsover Castle, often held to be the best of their kind in England. You will visit Haddon Hall, a house frozen in the time of William Shakespeare and an inspiration for the great Gothic novelist, Ann Radcliffe. We’ll be using a wide range of texts spanning the history of literature from Thomas More’s ‘Utopia’ to Oscar Wilde’s ‘Canterville Ghost’. Along the way we will examine sections from a play by Shakespeare, poetry by Margaret Cavendish, and brief passages from novels by Jane Austen, and Charles Dickens. We will even look at fiction by a country house resident Georgiana, Duchess of Devonshire. During this course you’ll learn to analyse literature using a technique called ‘close reading’.

Cancer cells form part of complex tissues, containing different cell types, each with their own unique set of rules of behaviour. As a class, we will explore this unique genetic landscape of cancer cells. We will introduce the concept of DNA mutations and the emerging area of epigenetics and identify how they confer a selective advantage to cancer cells with unstable DNA, leading to uncontrolled cell division and tumour growth. The course will give an overview of the main molecular genetic pathways that are disrupted in cancer cells, starting with the 3 ‘Ds’: the complex cellular signals controlling cell Division (via oncogenes and tumour suppressor genes) cell Death (apoptosis) cell Differentiation (formation of specialised cell types). We will also introduce the concept of cancer stem cells. Other key cancer pathways of angiogenesis (stimulating new blood vessel growth) and metastasis (tumour spread) will also be covered. Finally, we will discuss how our understanding of these pathways has informed the design of new treatments for cancer and some of the emerging challenges in the future.

Whether you run your own business or are a cog in a bigger wheel you can be an agent for change and help push forward innovation. Very few innovative ideas are new; the vast majority take something that is already working and improve it. This may be a product, service or process. Those who are closest to the business often have the most innovative ideas. You will complete this course understanding how to turn ideas into reality for the benefit of the business and, in many cases, the wider society and the way we live. Using case studies from the University of Leeds and major high street retailer Marks & Spencer, we connect theory and practice to demonstrate the importance of innovation in growing and sustaining a business. You will explore a range of important innovations including the introduction of chilled foods and the development of man-made fibres. We look at how the ideas emerged and developed and their impact not only on business but also on how we live our lives today. Through the course you will see that innovation can take many forms and that innovation needs people and organisations with a willingness to embrace change, to wonder ‘what if’, to challenge the status quo and most importantly to work together – successful innovations need both determined individuals and a collaborative approach.

They also help you in life.\nHere''s how the course will work.\nFor each model, I present a short, easily digestible overview lecture. Then, I''ll dig deeper. I''ll go into the technical details of the model. Those technical lectures won''t require calculus but be prepared for some algebra. For all the lectures, I''ll offer some questions and we''ll have quizzes and even a final exam. If you decide to do the deep dive, and take all the quizzes and the exam, you''ll receive a certificate of completion. If you just decide to follow along for the introductory lectures to gain some exposure that''s fine too. It''s all free. And it''s all here to help make you a better thinker!<br><br><b>Subtitles for</b>&nbsp;<b>all video lectures available in</b>:&nbsp;Chinese (provided by&nbsp;<a href="http://coursera.yeeyan.org/" target="_blank">Yeeyan</a>),&nbsp;English,&nbsp;Ukrainian (<a href="http://pinchukfund.org/en/">Pinchuk Foundation</a>)<br>', 'https://www.coursera.org/course/modelthinking', 'http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX5LBZvEh10', '2015-10-05', 10, 'https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/modelthinking/large-icon.png', 'Economics & Finance', 'Coursera', 0, 'English', 'yes', ' University of Michigan', '2014-05-18 22:40:02'),

Students have access to lectures\nwith in-video quizzes, multiple-choice quiz assignments, automatically-checked\ninteractive programming exercises, midterm and final exams, a discussion\nforum, optional additional exercises with solutions, and pointers to readings\nand resources.

Databases reside behind a huge\nfraction of websites; they''re a crucial component of telecommunications\nsystems, banking systems, video games, and just about any other software\nsystem or electronic device that maintains some amount of persistent information.\nIn addition to persistence, database systems provide a number of other\nproperties that make them exceptionally useful and convenient: reliability,\nefficiency, scalability, concurrency control, data abstractions, and high-level\nquery languages. Databases are so ubiquitous and important that computer\nscience graduates frequently cite their database class as the one most\nuseful to them in their industry or graduate-school careers.', 'https://www.coursera.org/course/db', 'http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=', '0000-00-00', 0, 'https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/b5/62b8827c61b48597f9b526ce04aaee/dbLogo.jpg', 'Computer Science: Systems & Security', 'Coursera', 0, 'English', 'yes', ' Stanford University', '2014-05-18 22:40:02'),

(344, 'Neuroethics', 'This course will examine the ethical, legal and social issues raised by neuroscience. Topics will include the implications of new knowledge of the brain for our understanding of selfhood, for the meaning of privacy, for the distinction between therapy and enhancement, and for national security.', '“Perhaps a man really dies when his brain stops, when he loses the power to take in a new idea.” --George Orwell<br><br> Neuroethics might well be the most rapidly growing area within bioethics; indeed, in some respects neuroethics has grown as an independent field, with its own journals, professional society and institutional centers. This growth over the past decade is partly attributable to the growth of neuroscience itself and to the challenging philosophical and moral questions it inherently raises. A 2012 Royal Society report observes that “(a)n increasingly mechanistic understanding of the brain raises a host of ethical, legal, and social implications.

This growth over the past decade is partly attributable to the growth of neuroscience itself and to the challenging philosophical and moral questions it inherently raises. A 2012 Royal Society report observes that “(a)n increasingly mechanistic understanding of the brain raises a host of ethical, legal, and social implications.

These are some of the \nquestions that arise in the context of rationing and allocating scarce \nhealth care resources among particular individuals, and concern what are\n called micro-allocation decisions. But trade-offs also need to be made \nat the meso- and macro-level. Budgets of public payers of healthcare, \nsuch as governments, and of private ones, such as health plans, are \nlimited: they cannot cover all drugs and services that appear beneficial\n to patients or physicians. So what services should they provide? Is \nthere a core set of benefits that everyone should be entitled to? How \ncan we make fair decisions, if we know from the outset than not all \nneeds can be met? Using the cases of organs for transplantation, the \nrationing for vaccines in a flu pandemic, and drug shortages, the course\n will critically examine alternative theories for allocating scarce \nresources among individuals, while also exploring the principles and \nvalues that underlie those theories.</p>\n<div></div>', 'https://www.coursera.org/course/rationing', 'http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtheNsEOW5c', '2013-05-20', 7, 'https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/rationing/large-icon.png', 'Health & Society', 'Coursera', 0, 'English', 'yes', ' University of Pennsylvania', '2014-05-18 22:40:15'),

A second reason is that scientific reasoning in general and Chemistry reasoning in particular are inductive processes. &nbsp;This Concept Development approach illustrates those reasoning processes. &nbsp;A third reason is that this is simply more interesting. &nbsp;The structure and reactions of matter are fascinating puzzles to be solved by observation and reasoning. &nbsp;It is more fun intellectually when we can solve those puzzles together, rather than simply have the answers to the riddles revealed at the outset.', 'https://www.coursera.org/course/genchem1', 'http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GaESBUPHSw', '2013-03-04', 10, 'https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/genchem1/large-icon.png', 'Chemistry', 'Coursera', 0, 'English', 'yes', ' Rice University', '2014-05-18 22:40:30'),

What Feynman was referring to are some of the “spooky” phenomena like quantum entanglement, which are incomprehensible from the standpoint of classical physics.

', '<p>In this course,\nwe will examine the main bodies of economic theory that have been used to guide\neconomists’ and policy makers’ understanding of the macroeconomy. Macroeconomics\nis a word derived from the Greek prefix “makros”, meaning large. It is the study\nof economic aggregates, of national and international economies and of the\neconomic management role played by governments and international organisations.\n</p>\n\n<p>The founder of\nmodern macroeconomics, the British economist John Maynard Keynes, famously wrote\n“The ideas of economists and political philosophers, both when they are right\nand when they are wrong are more powerful than is commonly understood. Indeed,\nthe world is ruled by little else. Practical men, who believe themselves to be\nquite exempt from any intellectual influences, are usually slaves of some\ndefunct economist.” This will be the key theme we explore in the course, the\ninfluence of theory and the way that policy responses to events like recession,\nunemployment, inflation and the Global Financial Crisis, reflect that theory.</p>\n\n<p>We will cover\nimportant macroeconomic concepts such as the national accounts, unemployment\nand inflation, explain how the ideas associated with John Maynard Keynes laid\nthe foundation for governments’ active management of the macroeconomy in the\npost war era, and examine the intellectual basis for the monetary and fiscal\npolicy responses to the Global Financial Crisis.&nbsp; Economists’ approaches to the analysis of\nlong run economic growth will also be considered. The approach will be\ncritical. There are few areas of human endeavour that attract so much debate\nand disagreement as the management of a modern industrial economy. We will not\nshy away from those debates. But what we will do is emphasise the systematic\ntheorising that underlies the way macroeconomists and policy makers approach\ntheir task.

We shall be concerned with the relations\nbetween culture and historical change, and our materials shall be drawn from a\nvariety of areas: philosophy, the novel, and critical theory. Finally, we shall try to\ndetermine what it means to be modern today, and whether it makes sense to go\nbeyond the modern to the postmodern.\n\n\n\n<p><i>The Modern and the Postmodern</i> traces the intertwining of the\nidea of modernity with the idea of art or culture from the late 18th\ncentury until the present. Beginning with the Enlightenment, Western cultures\nhave invested heavily in the notion that the world can be made more of a home\nfor human beings through the development of culture (and technology).\nThroughout this period there has also developed a strong, sophisticated\ncounter-movement that sees the Enlightenment effort as a disaster – destructive\nof both art and of the world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The\nWestern idea of modernity is linked to but not the same as the idea of\nmodernism.

The current\n    understanding of human history and social theory is based largely on Western\n    experience or on non-Western experience seen through a Western lens. This\n    course offers alternative perspectives derived from Chinese experience\n    during the last three centuries. We present specific case studies of the\n    new scholarship of discovery divided into three independent parts, which\n    means that students can take any Part without prior or subsequent attendance\n    of the other Parts. Part 1 addresses the issue of “Who Gets What” and covers\n    sequentially inequality and education, education and social mobility, social\n    mobility and wealth distribution, and wealth distribution and regime change.\n    Part 2 turns to the related issue of “Who Survives” and includes studies\n    of inequality and population behavior, population behavior and human development,\n    human development and social organization, and social organization and\n    social stratification.

We will then examine the components necessary to record audio into a computer, so that you understand the devices that sound must travel through in a music production process. <br>    <br>Once recorded, sound must be organized along a timeline, a process known as editing. It allows us to give the impression of perfect performances and create many of the sounds we hear in contemporary music.

We will explore the basic functionality of both hardware and software mixing boards, including volume, pan, mute, solo, busses, inserts, sends, and submixes. The mixing process, however, includes more tools than the mixing board provides on its own. Sound must also be processed, modified from its recorded state to fit the context of the music.

Application areas within NLP include automatic (machine) translation between languages; dialogue systems, which allow a human to interact with a machine using natural language; and information extraction, where the goal is to transform unstructured text into structured (database) representations that can be searched and browsed in flexible ways. NLP technologies are having a dramatic impact on the way people interact with computers, on the way people interact with each other through the use of language, and on the way people access the vast amount of linguistic data now in electronic form. From a scientific viewpoint, NLP involves fundamental questions of how to structure formal models (for example statistical models) of natural language phenomena, and of how to design algorithms that implement these models.</p>\n\n<p>In this course you will study mathematical and computational models of language, and the application of these models to key problems in natural language processing.

Despite many improvements in processors, storage, and networks, however, developing quality software on-time and on-budget remains hard. Moreover,\n    developing high quality <i>reusable\n</i> concurrent and&nbsp;networked software apps and services is even harder. &nbsp;The principles, methods, and&nbsp;skills required to develop such software are best learned by&nbsp;attaining mastery of&nbsp;<i>patterns</i>, <i>pattern languages</i>,\n    and <i>frameworks</i>.</p>\n<p>\n\n    A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern">pattern</a>&nbsp;describes a reusable solution to a common problem that arises within a particular context. When related patterns are woven together they form a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern_language">pattern language</a> that\n    defines a vocabulary and a process for the orderly resolution of software development problems. A&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_framework">framework</a>&nbsp;is an integrated set of components that collaborate to provide a reusable\n    architecture for a family of related apps or services. &nbsp;Frameworks can also be viewed as concrete realizations of pattern languages that facilitate direct reuse of detailed design and source code.</p>\n<p>\n\n    This MOOC describes <i>by example</i> how to apply patterns, pattern languages, and frameworks to&nbsp;alleviate the complexity of developing concurrent and networked&nbsp;software for mobile devices via the use of object-oriented design techniques,\n    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)" target="_blank">Java</a>programming language features, and&nbsp;<a href="http://developer.android.com/" target="_blank">Android&nbsp;</a>middleware.

War has become virtually unthinkable in the EU. When the first\n    steps towards supranational cooperation - primarily targeted at preventing\n    the rearmament of Germany - were made in the aftermath of World War Two,\n    the Founding Fathers of the European integration construct could never\n    have imagined this outcome in their wildest dreams. Over the years, the\n    supranational cooperation would widen - from the original European Communities\n    consisting of 6 Member States to the current Union of 27 Members – and\n    deepen – from the originally almost purely economically inspired Communities\n    to the current Union with a say in almost all areas of national competence.\n    At the same time, problems with the Euro have plunged the EU in one of\n    the biggest crises since its inception. This challenges lawmakers to tackle\n    difficult questions about the continued existence of the Euro and the future\n    direction of the European integration project.</p>\n<p>This course will give the students an insight into the law of the EU,\n    a vast and fascinating area of law which forms an integral part of the\n    legal systems of its 27 Member States. The course is divided into three\n    parts. In the first part, we will pay attention to the creation and the\n    development of the EU, its institutional structure and functioning, and\n    the specific nature and sources of EU law. In the second part, we will\n    examine how EU law impacts on the lives of EU citizens as well as on companies\n    that are established or provide services in the EU. In the final\n    part, we will tackle Europe’s common currency crisis, investigating causes,\n    effects and possible routes out of this existential crisis of the Union.</p>\n<p>If you are a student, lawyer, entrepreneur or simply interested in the\n    EU, its&nbsp;development and legal system, this course will provide you\n    with the foundations.&nbsp;The course is of interest to people both inside\n    and outside the European Union: EU citizens may learn how to benefit from\n    the rights contained in EU life; people from other parts of the world may\n    learn from the EU’s specific set-up, its functioning and the legal solutions\n    being applied in the European context.</p>', 'https://www.coursera.org/course/introeulaw', 'http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJv6XMFsKwI', '2013-06-10', 5, 'https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/4a/eb093dc24f8ae7acfbc3e3654c8f28/logo-for-the-class.jpg', 'Humanities ', 'Coursera', 0, 'English', 'yes', ' Universiteit Leiden', '2014-05-18 22:41:24'),

Although it is the most widely studied behavior disorder of childhood, its etiology remains unclear, its outcome is variable, and its treatment is complex and moderately successful. Advances in neuroscience have provided new insights into the pathophysiology of ADHD, pointing to key neural circuits involved in attention, behavioral control, learning, and reward maintenance that appear to be underperforming in patients with the disorder. Moreover, the etiology of this heterogeneous disorder points to the key role of genetic and environmental interactions during prenatal and perinatal periods. Over the past decade, new diagnostic and interventional approaches have enabled clinicians to better diagnose and treat ADHD across the lifespan, while longitudinal studies have elucidated the long-term impact of the disorder on health and adaptive functioning.<br><br>This course is intended for students with a background in psychology and/or neuroscience who are interested in learning more about the complexities of ADHD from both scientific and clinical perspectives. Scientific topics covered include prevalence and epidemiology, diagnostic criteria, clinical presentation at different ages, impact on development (intellect, academic, speech and language, emotional self control, motivation and executive functioning), health outcomes (risk taking, accidents, injuries, driving difficulties, unintended pregnancy), co-existing conditions (anxiety, mood, substance use disorders), and etiology (genetic, pre/perinatal, neurodevelopmental, neuroanatomic, neuropsychological).

Who determines success?\n    Since personal investment yields better writing, you can select an area of expertise meaningful to you (a hobby, trade, profession, discipline, etc.) for your major writing projects, which will be drafted and revised in sequenced stages: a critical\n    review to an argument about expertise (600-800 words); an explication of a visual image (600-800 words); a case study of an expert (1000-1250 words) and an Op-Ed (500-750 words). Your writing will be central to the course as we create a seminar/workshop\n    structure with peer response and selected instructor feedback.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Two overarching assumptions about academic writing will shape our work:&nbsp; 1) it is transferable; 2) it is learnable. Being an effective academic writer involves asking meaningful questions and engaging in complex dialogue with texts and ideas. These\n    skills are useful across virtually all academic disciplines and they provide a valuable means for making sense of non-academic experiences as well. Perhaps even more important, though, is that learning how to write effectively does not require inspiration\n    or genius, but hard work, reflection, and feedback. This means that, with practice, dedication, and working with others,<i> you</i> can be an effective academic writer and contribute your ideas to important, ongoing conversations.

The focus is on computational methods for inferring phylogenetic trees from sequence data, and the course will give an introduction to the fundamental theory and algorithms, while also giving the student hands-on experience with some widely used software tools. Since evolutionary theory is the conceptual foundation of biology (in the words of Theodosius Dobzhansky: "Nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution"), what you learn on this course will be relevant for any project you will ever do inside the life sciences. A phylogenetic tree will almost always help you think more clearly about your biological problem. </div><div><br></div><div>A special emphasis is put on methods that employ explicit models of the evolutionary process (maximum likelihood and Bayesian approaches), and we will explore the role of statistical modeling in molecular evolution, and in science more generally. A mathematical (statistical) model of a biological system can be considered to be a stringently phrased hypothesis about that system, and this way of thinking about models will often be helpful. In addition to model-based methods, you will also learn about other approaches, such as those based on parsimony and genetic distance (<i>e.g.</i>, neighbor joining). </div><div><br></div><div>Often, the evolutionary tree is the result we are interested in - knowing how a set of sequences (or organisms) are related can provide us with important information about the biological problem we are  investigating.

The focus is on computational methods for inferring phylogenetic trees from sequence data, and the course will give an introduction to the fundamental theory and algorithms, while also giving the student hands-on experience with some widely used software tools. Since evolutionary theory is the conceptual foundation of biology (in the words of Theodosius Dobzhansky: "Nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution"), what you learn on this course will be relevant for any project you will ever do inside the life sciences. A phylogenetic tree will almost always help you think more clearly about your biological problem. </div><div><br></div><div>A special emphasis is put on methods that employ explicit models of the evolutionary process (maximum likelihood and Bayesian approaches), and we will explore the role of statistical modeling in molecular evolution, and in science more generally.

We will analyse the fate of Michel\nServet, a learned Spanish man who was condemned for heresy and executed\nin Geneva in 1553.

The course will offer a deeper\nunderstanding of the creative forces behind film and television, of how\nScandinavian society and culture has influenced the production. The course will\ndeal with the co-production in Scandinavia and the role of Scandinavian film\nand television internationally. Theoretically the course will deal with\nnational and global cinema, with film and media sociology, with genre and\nauteur theory and with film and media policy.</span></p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>The course will also deal with some of the\nmost important film directors and film and television genres and the way they\nhave reflected and influenced our understanding of Scandinavia and the image of\nScandinavian culture and society abroad. From Carl Th. Dreyer’s complex\nhistorical and religious dramas, Ingmar Bergman’s symbolic and psychological\nfilms to the modern cinema of Lars von Trier, Aki Kaurismäki, Lukas Moodyson\nand Bent Hamer - all important Scandinavian names in a broader European art\ncinema tradition.  The course will deal\nwith typical examples of other and more popular genres in Scandinavian cinema\nand modern, Scandinavian television drama and with aspects of the Scandinavian\ndocumentary tradition. Examples include Jan Troell’s epic serial <i>The Immigrants/The New Land </i>(1971-72), global,\nprize winning drama series like <i>The\nKilling</i> (2007-12) and <i>Borgen</i> (2010-)\nand international film blockbusters such as the Stieg Larson trilogy.</span></p>', 'https://www.coursera.org/course/scanfilmtv', 'http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN4YuHHmK58', '2014-02-03', 10, 'https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/22/c796d9046014cdcd7cbccac941de43/scandinavian_film.jpg', 'Humanities ', 'Coursera', 0, 'English', 'yes', ' University of Copenhagen', '2014-05-18 22:41:45'),

Our goal\nwill be to go behind the myth-making and beyond the popularized presentations\nof relativity in order to gain a deeper understanding of both Einstein\nthe person and the concepts, predictions, and strange paradoxes of his\ntheory. Some of the questions we will address include: How did Einstein\ncome up with his ideas? What was the nature of his genius? What is the\nmeaning of relativity? What’s “special” about the special theory of relativity?\nWhy did the theory initially seem to be dead on arrival? What does it mean\nto say that time is the “fourth dimension”? Can time actually run more\nslowly for one person than another, and the size of things change depending\non their velocity? Is time travel possible, and if so, how? Why can’t things\ntravel faster than the speed of light? Is it possible to travel to the\ncenter of the galaxy and return in one lifetime? Is there any evidence\nthat definitively confirms the theory, or is it mainly speculation? Why\ndidn’t Einstein win the Nobel Prize for the theory of relativity?\n<br>\n<br>Students may choose one of three approaches to the course: a more quantitative\napproach, a more qualitative approach, or an auditing approach.

Together, UVA and Monticello are recognized internationally as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.', 'Born in an age ruled by monarchs, Thomas\nJefferson thought that power ought to belong to those who possessed “virtue and\ntalent” rather than to aristocrats who had inherited it. He rejected the power\nof kings in favor of ordinary people, believing that all men are created equal\nand possess inherent natural rights. Jefferson became a powerful spokesman for\na revolutionary generation of Americans who created a new nation based on these\nradical ideas. Thomas Jefferson remains today a pivotal figure in\nAmerican history whose influence continues to be felt nearly two centuries\nafter his death, both in the United States and around the world.  This\ncourse will offer an introduction to Jefferson’s thought, focusing on several\nkey ideas and themes that engaged Jefferson throughout his public career and\nprivate life.  We will address the three achievements that Jefferson asked\nto be listed on his tombstone by discussing his roles in writing the Declaration\nof Independence, in advocating religious freedom, and in advancing the cause of\neducation by founding the University of Virginia.  We will also seek to\nunderstand what Jefferson meant when he proclaimed that “the earth belongs to\nthe living.”  And, crucially, we will explore Jefferson’s lifelong\nrelationship with the institution of slavery.<br><br><p>To\nunderstand Jefferson’s ideas and why they continue to be relevant today, our\napproach in each lecture will be to situate Jefferson in the context of his own\ntime and place.  Jefferson lived for many years in different\nplaces—Philadelphia, New York, Paris, and Washington D.C., to name but a\nfew—but there is little doubt that he considered his home, Monticello, and the\nnearby town of Charlottesville, in central Virginia, to be the center of his\nworld.  In this course, produced by the University of Virginia in close\npartnership with the Thomas Jefferson Foundation, we will explore how\nJefferson’s identification with Monticello and the surrounding area influenced\nhim as he formulated ideas that have made a global impact.  After\ncompleting the course it should be clear not only why Jefferson''s legacy is\nessential to understanding American history, but also why UNESCO has designated\nJefferson’s Monticello and the University of Virginia as a World Heritage Site.</p>', 'https://www.coursera.org/course/jefferson', 'http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HzbjtzijUk', '2014-02-17', 6, 'https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/83/92701b94ec68ff7bffb6da07751e57/jefferson.jpg', 'Humanities ', 'Coursera', 0, 'English', 'yes', ' University of Virginia Monticello', '2014-05-18 22:42:12'),

If you are a NU alum and have reached this page from the voucher link, you are enrolled in the upcoming June session. &nbsp;If you have any questions about the MOOC, please contact the Media Management Center at&nbsp;</strong><a href="mailto:mediamanagementcenter@northwestern.edu" title="Link: mailto:mediamanagementcenter@northwestern.edu">mediamanagementcenter@northwestern.edu</a>.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>The next public session will begin in October 2014.&nbsp;</strong><br><br>Why Content Strategy is essential for professionals in any organization&nbsp;–&nbsp;business,\nnon-profit, or government.\n<br>\n<br>Content Strategy is a conversation that provides thought-leadership. It\nstarts a “conversation” with users and stakeholders inside and outside\nan organization.&nbsp; Conversations are the natural way people think about\ncomplex issues. Conversations also enable people to develop “stories,”\nwhich lead to understanding and helpful mental pictures. Content Strategy\npractitioners are at all levels of the best enterprises – in all departments\nand sectors from the top leader to the newcomer in the ranks.\n<br>\n<br>In this complex information age, forward-thinking employees know that\nif they and their organizations are to thrive, they need to go beyond their\njob descriptions. They must master the most demanding communications frontier\n– creating engaging, strategic, honest stories and information that is\nvalued by their most important audiences. In turn that will make their\nenterprise stand out.\n<br>\n<br>Regardless of their department, area of work, or expertise, Content Strategy\npractitioners know how to use words, pictures, video, and social and mobile\nmedia to interact with their most important constituents with trustable,\nactionable information that the audience values and will use. The strategic\ncontent they produce enhances the audience’s lives and&nbsp;deepens their\nunderstanding and engagement with the organization.\n<br>\n<br>Content Strategy is similar to the best examples of journalism, but it\nis done by non-journalism organizations. Content Strategy is always honest,\ntrustable, and transparent. It tells all sides of every story it reports.\nOften it is also deeper and directed at topics and audiences that traditional\njournalism under-serves or does not reach at all. Content Strategy is not\nadvertising, marketing, or public relations. It is different because it\nnever pursues the persuasive goals that are appropriate in those disciplines.&nbsp;<br>', 'https://www.coursera.org/course/contentstrategy', 'http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N0pETpswn0', '3000-00-00', 6, 'https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/3a/3cba8aad9c65ffb7c24b78f5eb3cb4/Content_Strategy_MOOC_ReColor---Sized.jpg', 'Information, Tech & Design', 'Coursera', 0, 'English', 'yes', ' Northwestern University', '2014-05-18 22:42:17'),

When you ask parents about\ntheir goals for their children, they almost always respond with terms like,\n<i>“successful,” “happy,”\n“curious,”</i> and <i>“being kind to others.”</i> But when you ask schools\nabout their goals, they often reply in terms of academic content, like <i>“algebra,” “subject-verb\nagreement,”</i> and <i>“the periodic table.”</i> \n<br>\n<br>Great teachers have always united those two visions.\n<br>\n<br>This course explores the interconnection between character research, education,\nand academic rigor.

Young children learn many of these skills through the interactions they have with their teachers. This course is intended to increase teachers’ knowledge about specific types of teacher-child interactions that promote young children’s development. The course will focus on helping teachers to offer emotionally supportive interactions to the children in their care.', '<p>When we look at the research about what teachers actually do each day\n    that makes a difference in children’s lives, there’s clear evidence that\n    it’s the daily interactions that teachers have with children that are most\n    important.  And we know quite a bit about the specific type of interactions\n    that lead to children’s development and learning.  So this course\n    focuses on those interactions.  By the end of the course, you should\n    have a deep knowledge and understanding of the types of interactions that\n    foster learning and development among your students. <br></p><p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</p><p>Although there are many types of interactions that are critical to\nyoung children’s development, this course will focus on one area in particular\n– Emotional Support. </p>\n\n<p>This course focuses on Emotional Support because it is really the\nfoundation of every early childhood classroom. In classrooms that are\nEmotionally Supportive children and adults are comfortable with one another and\nexcited about learning. They look forward to spending time together and know\nthat, even when times are tough, there will be someone there to help them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</p><p>What do you need to <b>know</b> to be a really effective early childhood\n    teacher?

In this course we’ll focus a bit on knowledge about\n    children’s development and we’ll spend lots of time focused on knowledge\n    about specific types of classroom interactions that promote learning and\n    development.</p>\n<p>Another part of effective teaching is <b>seeing</b>. All the knowledge\n    in the world about effective teaching is only a piece of the puzzle. Good\n    teachers need to see what effective teaching looks like – in lots of different\n    types of classrooms, with lots of different types of children. Teachers\n    tell us they don’t get nearly enough opportunities to see other teachers\n    teach and they report how helpful these experiences are when they do get\n    them. We’ll spend lots of time in this course focused on observing classroom\n    videos and we’ll also ask you to spend some time watching yourself teach.</p>\n<p>Ultimately we can’t learn to be an effective teacher without practice\n    – we need to spend some time <b>doing</b> – enacting the teaching practices\n    that we’ll learn about. Just as young children need to do things to really\n    learn about them – you need to spend some time practicing the types of\n    interactions we’ll be talking about.</p>\n<p>There’s one last important element to being an effective teacher. Effective \n    teachers spend time <b>reflecting</b> on their practice. We think of this\n    a bit like taking time to really look at your teaching through a magnifying\n    glass – we’ll give you time to reflect on your teaching and what you have\n    learned throughout this course.</p>\n<p>Much of this course is based on the research of Drs. Robert Pianta, Bridget\n    Hamre and many colleagues UVA and other institutions using the Classroom\n    Assessment Scoring System – or CLASS(™). CLASS is an observational measure\n    used in research and practice that defines specific elements of effective\n    teaching. In this course you will see examples of the kinds of teaching\n    practices assessed by the CLASS.

That starts with preparing teachers to receive critical\nfeedback, and then continues with a careful selection of goals and scaffolds to\nensure that feedback is implemented with fidelity. </p>\n\n<p><span>Oftentimes, teacher coaching suffers from a lack of\ndirection, a lack of support, or both. The coach might tell the teacher to “Do\nX,” but then fail to articulate clear, measurable steps for\nimplementation.&nbsp; Most commonly, coaches\ncan be overly suggestive, telling the teacher “You <i>might</i> do X, Y, and Z,\nand <i>maybe</i> even A, B, and C, too.” With an already very full plate, this\napproach leaves the teacher uncertain of what to focus on first, undercutting\nthe likelihood of meaningful change. </span></p>\n\n<p>Even teacher coaching that’s described as “good” can sometimes\nfall short of resulting in meaningful change.

', '<p><b>On the Hunt for Feedback: Self-Directed Teacher Improvement </b></p>\n\n<p></p><p>Teaching\nis isolating. &nbsp;Most of the work happens behind a closed door.\n&nbsp;Teachers want feedback about their teaching, but encounter three\nproblems:</p>\n\n<p>1.\nThey don''t get much. &nbsp;The principal or department head doesn''t visit very\noften. &nbsp;And there’s no built-in structure at their school for peer\nobservation. </p>\n\n<p>2.\nThe feedback isn''t helpful or actionable. </p>\n\n<p>Sometimes\nit''s just happy talk -- 98% of American teachers are rated satisfactory -- and\nwhile everyone likes a pat on the back, evaluations that say "you were\nwonderful" don''t make better teachers. &nbsp;Or sometimes the feedback is\ncritical in ways that don’t present clear next steps. &nbsp;Sometimes it''s\nvague or just plain wrong. &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>3.\nSome teachers can be defensive. &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>(Yes,\nwe know – only SOME people are defensive, but not YOU. &nbsp;You are different.\n&nbsp;You handle feedback with grace, confidence, and a "let''s fix\nthis" orientation. {Except&nbsp;sometimes maybe not.}) </p>\n\n<p>***</p>\n\n<p>This\ncourse is based on a simple idea: that teachers take control of their own\nimprovement by aggressively seeking out and acting upon feedback about their\nteaching. </p>\n\n<p><span>The\nidea may be simple, but the work is not. So we should say straight up: <b>this\nis NOT a typical MOOC</b>. Participants in this MOOC won’t improve their\nteaching skills by just watching lectures. Participants also won’t really take\nanything away from this MOOC if they do it “a la carte:” we believe they need\nto do every part of every assignment in order to leverage the kinds of changes\nin practice that we think are possible in a course like this. </span></p>\n\n<p>We\nall wish that our public school system was such that every teacher would have\neasy access to great coaching – or even any coaching at all. But unfortunately that’s\nnot the world we live in. Indeed, high school athletes can EXPECT to be\ncoached, but schoolteachers somehow need to track it down themselves. Teachers\ndeserve better. But they have a choice: bemoan\nthe lack of legit coaching that they get and will likely continue to get, or\nbecome the rare teacher who builds her own improvement loop. &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><b>Class\n1: The Big Picture on Teacher Feedback</b></p>\n\n<p>We\nwill review the realities of teacher feedback in typical schools, looking at\nwhere that feedback usually comes to teachers and how it’s processed.&nbsp; In\nmost schools, the teacher plays a passive role in this—waiting until an\nevaluation comes to them.&nbsp; We believe the best teachers create the\nopposite type of process: they HUNT down feedback, drag it back to their lairs,\nand use it. &nbsp;They realize that if they wait for good feedback to come to\nthem, they might wait a long, long time. &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><b>Class\n2:&nbsp; Case Study: Peer Feedback</b></p>\n\n<p>We\nprofile teachers&nbsp;who''ve&nbsp;asked their peers to give them critical\nfeedback. How did they ask their colleagues for help? What rubric or\nobservation protocol did they use? How did they choose what to focus on after\nthey got the feedback? What kind of action/improvement plan did the teacher\nwrite? What happened when the teachers tried to implement their action steps?\nWhat did their peers say when they came back to their classroom a few weeks\nlater? </p>\n\n<p>Participants\nin this course will do the exact same assignment: they will seek out feedback\nfrom a peer to generate their own action plan and a reflection on its\nimplementation. Participants will also be assigned to give and receive feedback\non these action plans from other students in our MOOC who are working on\nsimilar focus areas in similar contexts (e.g. other math teachers who are\ntrying to improve the rigor of their questioning). </p>\n\n<p><b>Class\n3:&nbsp;Case Study: Student Feedback</b> &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>First\nwe review the emerging new evidence, from the Gates Foundation MET Project,\nabout student surveys and their power for accurately assessing teachers’\nstrengths and weaknesses. &nbsp;Then, similar to the Peer Feedback class, we\nshow a teacher going through all the steps, interspersed with commentary from\nthe course instructor.</p>\n\n<p>Again,\nour MOOC participants will do the same assignment: create a student survey\n(we’ll show you examples); administer the survey; tabulate the data; write and\nimplement a plan; and get and give feedback from/to a peer with a similar focus\narea. </p>\n\n<p><b>Class\n4: Case Study: Assessment Data</b></p>\n\n<p>First\nwe cover the evidence of how schools and teachers are using student assessment\ndata to drive instructional improvements.

In order to study the behavior of such functions we’ll need to first understand the basic objects involved, namely the complex numbers. We’ll begin with some history: When and why were complex numbers invented? Was it the need for a solution of the equation x^2 = -1 that brought the field of complex analysis into being, or were there other reasons? Once we’ve answered these questions we’ll devote some time to learn about basic properties of complex numbers that will make it possible for us to use them in more advanced settings later on. We will learn how to do basic algebra with these numbers, how they behave in limiting processes, etc. These facts enable us to begin the study of complex functions, and at this point we can already understand the basics about the construction of the Mandelbrot set and Julia sets (if you have never heard of \nthese that’s quite alright, but do look at \n<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set" title="Link: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set</a> for example to see some \nbeautiful pictures).<br><br>When studying functions we are often interested in their local behavior, more specifically, in how functions change as their argument changes. This leads us to studying complex differentiation – a more powerful concept than that which we learned in calculus. Don’t worry! We’ll help you remember facts from calculus in case you have forgotten.&nbsp; After this exploration we will be ready to meet the main players: analytic functions. These are functions that possess complex derivatives in lots of places, a fact which endows these functions with some of the most beautiful properties mathematics has to offer. We’ll explore these properties! <br><br>Who would want to differentiate without being able to undo it? Clearly we’ll have to learn about integration as well. But we are in the complex plane, so what are the objects we’ll integrate over? Curves! We’ll study these as well, and we’ll tie everything together via Cauchy’s beautiful and all encompassing integral theorem and formula.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br><br>Throughout this course we''ll tell you about some of the major theorems in the field (even if we won''t be able to go into depth about them) as well as some outstanding conjectures. <br>', 'https://www.coursera.org/course/complexanalysis', 'http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4UaEx5Nu4Hs', '2013-10-21', 6, 'https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/06/010f1043a0b6efc7ca3272d419b56f/Slide1.jpg', 'Mathematics', 'Coursera', 0, 'English', 'yes', ' Wesleyan University', '2014-05-18 22:42:57'),

Evariste Galois considère les symétries de ces racines et associe\nainsi à ce polynôme un groupe de permutations de ses racines, que l''on appelle\nmaintenant son groupe de Galois. Il dégage à cette occasion pour la première\nfois, dans ce cadre, la notion de groupe, maintenant omniprésente en\nmathématiques. Son étude lui permet d''expliquer pourquoi les racines d''une\néquation prise au hasard ne s''expriment en général pas par des formules\nalgébriques faisant intervenir ses coefficients à partir du degré 5, un\nrésultat démontré auparavant par Abel. Plus généralement, l''étude du groupe de\nGalois du polynôme permet de dire exactement quand une telle formule existe.\nC''est ce que l''on appelle la correspondance de Galois : elle relie d''une part\nla théorie des corps, d''autre part la théorie des groupes.<br><br>\n\n<p>Ce cours\nexpliquera cette théorie en n''utilisant que des résultats de base d''algèbre\nlinéaire.

To bring these concepts alive, the course will involve\n    in-­‐depth, hands-­‐on examples, implemented in the Android Platform, the fastest growing segment of the handheld system user base.

To explain or to excuse the ongoing hatred towards Jews, historians mix together terminologies and concepts drawn from religious theology, psychology, social theory and politics. The catch-all term "anti-Semitism" lumps together outbreaks of prejudice and victimization in different times and places.<br><br>In this course, we shall ask a different question. Our focus is not on why a majority society saw Jews as different or reacted with violence to Jews'' "otherness." Rather, we ask how in a society dedicated to religious uniformity one group of people was tolerated even though it refused to join the dominant faith. Many modern writers assume that Christianity, and perhaps religion itself, is inherently intolerant of non-believers. But we will see that neither religious nor secular world views necessarily lead to toleration or discrimination. The patterns of Christian-Jewish relations are both complex and intriguing.<br><br>Our question then is how did a religious society manage to practice tolerance, and under what circumstances did that practice break down?

We will cover the underlying algorithms starting from \nsimple sequence alignment and sequence search, and move on to genome \nalignment, next-generation sequencing data analysis,\n    and molecular pathway identification. We will use software and \ndatabases that we had developed in our own labs to illustrate how to \ndevelop new bioinformatics technologies. We will also use real cases to \ndemonstrate how to apply bioinformatics approaches\n    in life sciences research. In addition, we will try to provide a \nhistorical perspective of why and how some of the ideas were developed, bringing to our class a few renowned scientists to tell us about their seminal works and perspectives.<br><br>This MOOC is based on the popular "Methods in Bioinformatics" course \nthat we created in 2006 and taught in every fall semester since at \nPeking University. The first run of this MOOC at Coursera in fall, 2013 had over 17,000 registered students from over 40 countries.  We hope that this MOOC can help you acquire knowledge and skills in bioinformatics that can be valuable in your future study and research.<p>\n</p>\n\n<p><br> </p><p></p><p>欢迎选修北京大学MOOC课程“生物信息学：导论与方法”。</p><p>近三十年来，生命科学与计算科学飞速发展。生物信息学是一门生命科学与计算科学的前沿交叉学科。生物信息学产生和迅猛发展的主要推动力来自于新一代测序等高通量技术在生命科学领域越来越广泛的应用。目前，人和很多动植物的基因组已经被测序出来。已知DNA序列的数量已超过20兆亿碱基，每五个月翻一番。这些前所未有的大数据中蕴藏着很多尚不为人知的新发现、新知识，给生命科学研究带来新的历史机遇。但是同时，这些大数据不仅数量巨大、持续呈现指数增长的趋势，而且噪音高，异构程度高。准确、快速地分析这些数据需要先进的计算方法。</p><p>生物信息学是一门强大的新技术，是用来分析、存储、搜索海量生物医学数据的信息技术和计算技术。另一方面，生物信息学是一种研究生命科学问题的新方法、新思路，是一种从全基因组出发、从系统水平出发、基于数据整合，提出新假说、发现新规律的研究方法。在这门“生物信息学：导论与方法”网上课程中，我们将向您系统地讲授生物信息学主要概念及方法。课程内容从基础的序列比对开始，循序渐进，围绕深度测序数据分析、计算基因组学、分子通路鉴定等当前研究的前沿热点内容进行介绍与讨论。进一步地，我们会以我们实验室自己开发的算法、软件及数据库为例，告诉您如何开发新的生物信息学技术。我们将用具体实例展示给您，如何用生物信息学的方法及研究思路来解决生命科学里的实际问题。我们也邀请到几位生命科学领域资深教授介绍相关的生物信息学重要工作及生物信息学在生命科学中的作用。</p>\n\n本门课程基于我们自2006年起在北京大学开设的广受学生欢迎的“生物信息学方法”课程内容。2013年秋季首次在Coursera平台发布网上课程，有来自40多个国家的17,000多名学生注册。希望同学们通过本课程的学习，可以了解生物信息学的知识和技术，为后续的研究和学习打下坚实的基础。<br><br><br><br><br>', 'https://www.coursera.org/course/pkubioinfo', 'http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=', '2014-03-17', 6, 'https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/66/fcb8c7bc2b16212736fbd7fad363bb/600_3402.jpg', 'Computer Science: Theory', 'Coursera', 0, 'Chinese', 'yes', ' Peking University', '2014-05-18 22:43:26'),

(1233, 'Practical Ethics', 'Is abortion wrong? Should we eat animals? What is our responsibility to the world’s \npoor? This course will encourage you to examine your ethical beliefs on topics relevant \nto the ancient question posed by Socrates: “How am I to live?”', 'In this course you will be encouraged to think about some of the ethical issues that we all face in our daily lives, and as concerned, global citizens. The course will focus on the following topics:\n\n<b><br><br>Brain death and persistent vegetative state </b>\n<br>When is a person dead? In many countries death is now defined as “brain death,” but is this way of understanding death justified? How we define death is important, because it is connected to critical questions such as: When is organ donation permissible?\nWhen is it right to take someone off life support? And how should we treat individuals who are in a persistent vegetative state?\n<br>\n<br><b>Abortion and the moral status of embryos and fetus</b> \n<br>Most people would argue that it is always wrong to intentionally take the life of an innocent human being. This belief is often expressed in terms of support for the “sanctity of human life.” Is abortion or embryo research compatible with this idea? Does\nan embryo have a right to life from the beginning of conception, or is this right something it acquires gradually? When, if ever, is abortion justified?\n<br>\n<br><b>Making end of life decisions</b> \n<br>How do you distinguish wrongful killing from acts that are not regarded as wrong? Can it ever be right to end the life of someone who cannot express a view about whether he or she wants to live or die? How should we make life and death decisions for severely\nill infants? And can euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide be justified?\n<br>\n<br><b>Effective altruism\n</b>\n<br>We all spend money on items that are not necessities. In other parts of the world, people die for the want of food or medicines that cost a few cents. The common view is that giving to poor people in other countries is charity, something that is good\nto do, but not wrong if we don’t. But is that really true? This topic concerns what our responsibility is for people less well of than us, what the best cause is, and what good career choices are. How much we ought to do for others?\n<br>\n<br><b>Climate change</b> \n<br>On what principles should nations agree on the extent of their emissions of greenhouse gasses? Should the nations that have contributed most to climate change compensate the nations that are suffering, and will suffer, most from it? Or should some other\nprinciple of justice govern the way we allocate quotas for greenhouse gas emissions?\n<br>\n<br><b>Animals</b> \n<br>It is common to draw a sharp line between how we are allowed to treat human beings and what we are allowed to do to animals. We consider cannibalism abhorrent, but routinely raise and kill animals for food. We set strict guidelines for experimenting on\nhuman beings, but much more lax ones for experimenting on animals. Is this attitude to animals justifiable? One way to put this question is to ask: “Do animals have rights?” But the debate does not have to revolve around animal rights. It can also be\nput in terms of the idea of equality, and where it stops—that is, does equality only apply to human beings? This topic concerns how we should treat animals, and when experimentation on animals is justified.\n<br>\n<br><b>Environmental values</b> \n<br>It is one thing to argue that we can extend ethics beyond the boundary of our own species, to other sentient beings, but it is a quite different thing to hold that there is also intrinsic value in something that cannot feel anything, like plants, or isn’t\neven alive, like mountains and streams. Can such a claim be justified? If it cannot, what difference does it make to the case for wilderness protection?\n<br>\n<br><b>Why act ethically?</b> Many of you might reach the conclusion that the ethical life can be a demanding one. So why bother? Why act ethically, rather than doing whatever you please? This is an ancient question, which some philosophers have dismissed\nas illegitimate, and others have sought to answer, in various ways. It leads us to questions about the meaning of life, and what it is to lead a good life.\n<br><br>\n<p>This course will introduce you to some of the ways philosophers have approached these questions, as well as some of their answers. You will also be encouraged to question your own ethical beliefs, and in the process explore the extent to which reason\nand argument can play a role in everyday ethical decision-making.</p>', 'https://www.coursera.org/course/practicalethics', 'http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-trKNgq_tM', '2014-03-01', 12, 'https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/46/5293842ddcac25980f0ca400aae533/practicalethics-logo.png', 'Humanities ', 'Coursera', 0, 'English', 'yes', ' Princeton University', '2014-05-18 22:43:37'),

Their achievements bear directly on modern questions of politics, economics, and theology.', 'With its walls razed to ground by Babylon’s armies, Jerusalem joined a long line of ancient vanquished cities—from Ur and Nineveh and Persepolis to Babylon itself. While some recovered from the destruction, others did not.  But none responded to political catastrophe by fashioning the kind of elaborate and enduring monument to their own downfall that we find in the Bible. Most conquered populations viewed their subjugation as a source of shame. They consigned it to oblivion, opting instead to extol the golden ages of the past.  The biblical authors in contrast reacted to loss by composing extensive writings that acknowledge collective failure, reflect deeply upon its causes, and discover thereby a ground for collective hope.  <br> <br>Working through colorful biblical and ancient Near Eastern texts, and drawing on an array of comparative examples, the course illustrates the thoroughgoing manner with which biblical authors responded to defeat by advancing a demotic agenda that places the community at the center. The aim of the biblical authors was to create a nation, and they sought to realize this goal via a shared text, which includes stories and songs, wisdom and laws. This corpus of writings belongs, without a doubt, to humanity’s greatest achievements. Whereas the great civilizations of the Near East invested their energies and resources into monuments of stone that could be destroyed by invading armies, the biblical authors left a literary legacy that has been intensively studied until the present day. More important, these authors’ visionary response to defeat brought to light a radical new wisdom:  the notion that a people is greater than the state which governs it, and that a community can survive collapse when all of its members can claim a piece of the pie and therefore have a reason to take an active part in its collective life. <br> <br>The objectives of the course are to show: <br>—how biblical scholars work with archeological and comparative texts to study the Bible''s formation;<br>—how the Bible emerged from large-scale corporate crisis and rupture;<br>—that in our present state of uncertainty and instability we have much to learn from the various strategies the biblical authors adopted to create an enduring “people of the book”;<br>—that one doesn’t have to believe in God or accept the historicity of the Bible in order to appreciate its profound political messages;<br>—that the Bible offers modern societies a model for creating communities around a shared collection of texts, songs, and laws;<br>—and that the Bible itself has a major role to play in our futures.<br>', 'https://www.coursera.org/course/biblefuture', 'http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ntJ-wF2pE8', '2014-05-26', 7, 'https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/51/b1c0ccbfc15fb49e3719618b36929f/wright-class.jpg', 'Humanities ', 'Coursera', 0, 'English', 'yes', ' Emory University', '2014-05-18 22:43:56'),

It develops the fundamental concepts of derivatives and integrals of\nfunctions of several variables, and the basic tools for doing the relevant\ncalculations. The course is designed with a “content-based” approach, i. e. by\nsolving examples, as many as possible from real life situations.&nbsp;</p><p>The “why” and\n“where“ of the topics are discussed, as much as the “what” and the “how”. The\nanswers to the latter are the “definitions” and “proofs”, while the answers to\nthe first two tell the reason for studying a topic, and the areas where such\nideas are used.</p>\n\n<p>The transfer of knowledge through an organized deductive process plays an\nimportant role in mathematics (Aristotelian approach). An interactive\ncommunication between the teacher and the student through posing questions and\nanswering them leads to an effective method (Socratian method). The design of this\ncourse will benefit from the latter whenever feasible.</p>\n\n<p>Why do we study derivatives and integrals? Because derivatives express\nchange, and integrals define the cumulative results of many inputs. Change and\ngrowth through time or space are two basic aspects of life. Change is expressed\nwith the difference between two situations, and the cumulative result of many\ninputs is an additive process. Thus basically, calculus is an extension of what\nwe all learn as early as first grade as addition and subtraction. Calculus\nenables us to define and calculate instantaneous changes and growth by\ncontinuously varying inputs. Instantaneity of the changes and variability of\nthe inputs are handled by infinitesimal quantities. The final results are\nobtained in the limit where the infinitesimal changes become zero. The limit is\nthe central concept of calculus.</p>\n\n<p>A function defines the relationship between the inputs, which are the\nindependent variables, and outputs which are the dependent variables. The ratio\nof the infinitesimal changes in the dependent variable to those of the\nindependent variable leads to the concept of the “derivative”. Similarly, the\ncumulative outputs of entities such as matter, energy, area, surface, volume,\netc. are calculated by the sum of the dependent variable weighted by the\nchanges in the independent variable. This operation leads to the concept of\n“integral”. Just like in Grade One, where we observed that addition and\nsubtraction are the inverses of each other, so are integral and derivative. This\ncomplementarity between the derivative and integral is expressed by the two\n“fundamental theorems of calculus”. All this is studied in the “Calculus of\nSingle Variable Functions”.</p>\n\n<p>Why multivariables? Because real life problems involve several variables.\nOur environment is defined by three space variables and phenomena evolve in\nterms of a fourth which is time. People- made phenomena require many more\nvariables. The course offered here is built on the knowledge of calculus of\nsingle variable functions and extends the concepts and techniques to\nmultivariable functions. The concepts and techniques are, in most cases,\nnatural extensions and generalizations from those in single variable functions.\nHence, each topic will start the review of the fundamental concepts and\ncalculation techniques from the calculus of one variable functions. This review\nis an opportunity to supplement what a student missed in the earlier course on\nsingle variables, while advancing into relevant problems from real life that\ninvolve more than one variable.</p>\n\n<p>(Source: Attila Aşkar,\nCalculus of Multivariable Functions, Volume 2 of the set of Vol1: Calculus of\nSingle Variable Functions, Volume 3: Linear Algebra and Volume 4: Differential\nEquations.

Individuals engaging in S-ENT are usually referred to as social entrepreneurs, a term that describes resourceful individuals working to create social innovation. They do not only have to identify (or create) opportunities for social change (that so far have been unexploited), they must also muster the resources necessary to turn these opportunities into reality.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A typical example is Prof. Muhammad Yunus, founder of the Grameen Bank (Bangladesh) and recipient of the Nobel Peace prize in recognition of his contribution to poverty alleviation through the invention and popularization of Microfinance. Other examples include fair trade or car-sharing. Today many foundations aim to identify and promote social entrepreneurs. Two prominent examples are Ashoka and the Skoll Foundation. So called venture philanthropists adopt methods from the domain of venture capital, for example, encouraging social entrepreneurs to provide detailed business plans and to measure and report systematically on their social performance. Social Return on Investment (S-ROI) analysis is an example, of an emerging tool aiming to describe the social impact of S-ENT in dollar terms, relative to the philanthropic investment made.</p>', 'https://www.coursera.org/course/socialentrepeneur', 'http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=', '3000-00-00', 0, 'https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/af/8480e1a9eea0ee8b6371c052d8b734/banner3__1280x720px.png', 'Economics & Finance', 'Coursera', 0, 'English', 'yes', ' Copenhagen Business School', '2014-05-18 22:44:01'),

Most markets around the world do not look like Silicon Valley, and they never will. But there are other models\nto support new businesses. In transitioning markets (where entrepreneurs do not have much access to private sector financing), government officials, donors, and business leaders are experimenting with creative approaches to support the growth of entrepreneurs.\nNortheast Ohio, whose largest city is Cleveland, is one such community. During our time together in this course, we will be exploring some of these innovative approaches.\n<br>\n<br>A massive intervention of government and donor resources in Northeast Ohio has been in place for over ten years. In that time, Northeast Ohio has experienced success (including job creation and follow-on funding) with alternative methods of financing\nstartups, but it has not been easy. Yes, some progress has been made, but whether or not they''ve hit on ultimate success has yet to be determined. A dynamic entrepreneurial ecosystem takes many years, even decades, to develop. Government officials\nand donors typically are looking for shorter term success with their support programs which makes long-term support for entrepreneurship challenging.\n<br>\n<br>During this course, we will hear from entrepreneurs who have launched products and services ranging from medical devices to LED lights to whiskey. You will learn how these entrepreneurs engaged with resources made available to them through a variety of\nprograms and intermediary organizations. We have chosen to talk with many business people that are still in the process of developing their companies and whose ultimate success or failure is still to be determined.\n<br><br>In addition to learning about Cleveland''s attempts to support entrepreneurship, you will also be hearing in the lectures from leaders in selected markets around the world including Greece, Vietnam, Tunisia, Argentina, Rwanda and China about how they are working to support the growth of start-up companies.<br>\n<br>One of our goals is to learn from you how different communities around the world are approaching implementing strategies and methods to support businesses.

It will cover methods for generating new ideas, increasing motivation, and ways to increase your own creative ability through assessment and discussion. <br><br>The principal learning activity in the course is a series of "differents" where you will be challenged to identify and change your own cultural, habitual, and normal patterns of behavior. Creative prompts such as "eat something different" and "do something as a child" will encourage you to recognize your limits and overcome them. In addition, you are encouraged to understand that creativity is based on societal norms, and that by its nature, it will differ from and be discouraged by society; in this course, the persistence of the creative person is developed through practice. You will learn how to approach problems in divergent ways and apply this knowledge to your daily endeavors. ', 'https://www.coursera.org/course/cps', 'http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbVTJ7NbxVY', '2014-02-26', 7, 'https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/93/5978f070db11e3b193f36f53320c6a/Creativitymooc2.jpg', 'Information, Tech & Design', 'Coursera', 0, 'English', 'yes', ' University of Minnesota', '2014-05-18 22:44:12');

Why do some struggle academically while others excel at school despite minimal\n    study? Why do some suffer the ravages of a psychotic illness like schizophrenia while others enjoy a life free of mental illness? At the core to answering these questions is the ages-old "nature-nurture" debate: Are the behavioral differences among\n    us due predominantly to inborn natural differences or the cumulative impact of our experiences? The nature-nurture debate generated much controversy and acrimony within psychology, although today most are willing to retire the debate and declare both\n    sides victorious.</p>\n\n<p>This course provides an introduction to behavioral genetics, the field within psychology that demonstrated that Nature and Nurture both play a fundamental role in the development of psychological traits. We will explore how early behavioral genetic research\n    radically changed how psychologists conceptualized human behavior and how the mapping of the human genome is fundamentally altering current research approaches to a wide range of behavioral characteristics.

From the saved memories of Catholic churchmen, Jewish noble and\nmerchant families, as well as medieval lords and knight clans, students will\nstudy and contribute to an effort to revive long lost interactive and\ncooperative networks of people in Plasencia, Spain. <a href="http://youtu.be/YmLnlNg0R2c" target="_blank">And among the most textured, fascinating elements of our investigation is the history of Spain''s Jewish community, or the Sepharad.</a></p>\n\n<p><span>For example, students will evaluate the Spanish\nanti-Jewish <i>pogroms</i> of 1391 that led\nto the large scale conversion of Jews to Christianity (forced and voluntary). By\ndocumenting such incidents and the interaction of noteworthy families,\nreligious organizations, political networks, and economic partnerships, we will\nreconstruct the quintessential cultural dynamics that underlay the foundation\nof the Castilian world and impacted the broader European continent.</span></p><p></p><p>Within the documents that students\ntranscribe, we will encounter historical persons such as Zanfines Capa, the Jewish\nchainmail maker, who was a close associate of the Carvajal family of knights.\nIn this specific case, the Catholic Carvajal clan and their compatriots in the\ncathedral, the Santa Maria clan (formerly the Jewish Ha-Levis), leased\nchurch-owned properties to Jewish families (like the chainmail makers) at the expense of\ntheir political competitors, the Catholic Estuñiga family (the Counts of\nPlasencia and Bejar). In this event, competing and overlapping political and\nreligious jurisdictions are revealed as well as vibrant Catholic-Jewish\nalliances that sought to expel interloping secular lords.</p>\n\n<p>In sum, we will evaluate the lives of\nJews, Christians, and Muslims, in a vibrant fifteenth century Spanish community\non the edge of incredible events – the consolidation of Spain under Queen\nIsabel and King Ferdinand, the encounter with the New World, and the defeat of\nthe Islamic Kingdom of Granada Spain and the expulsion of the Jews from Iberia.</p>\n\n<p><i>The\nCourse Work</i><i>&nbsp;</i></p>\n\n<p><i>In\nthis specific course, students will:</i> (1) study the history of medieval Spain and the community of Plasencia,\n(2) explore the world of medieval manuscripts and texts, (3) learn to read\nhistorical documents, and (4) transcribe and evaluate these documents.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span>The primary source that students will be\ntranscribing in this course is <i>Book One\n(1399-1453)</i> of the <i>Capitulary Acts </i>of\nthe <i>Cathedral of Plasencia</i>, which is\na census-like accounting document that details the activities and business\ntransactions of the cathedral. Most students will work with the 19th\ncentury transcription of the original 15th century text.

This morning you got up and ate your breakfast, e.g., eggs, milk, bread, fresh fruits, and the like. After the breakfast, you drove your car to work or school. At your office, you used your computer, perhaps equipped with 27” LCD monitor. During your break, you drank a cup of coffee and played with your iPhone. So on and so forth. You probably take it for granted that you can enjoy all of these products. But if you take a closer look at how each of these products can be made and eventually delivered to you, you will realize that each one of these is no short of miracle. For example, which fruit do you like? Consider fresh strawberries. In order for the strawberries to be on your breakfast table, there must be numerous functions, activities, transactions, and people involved in planting, cultivating, delivering, and consuming strawberries. Moreover, all of these functions, activities, transactions, and people are connected as an integral chain, through which physical products like strawberries themselves and virtual elements such as information and communication flow back and forth constantly. By grouping related functions or activities, we have a supply chain, comprised of four primary functions such as supplier, manufacturer, distributor, and finally consumer. A supply chain is essentially a value chain.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>For the society or economy as a whole, the goal is to maximize value, i.e., to create satisfactory value without spending too much. In order to create the maximum value for the strawberry supply chain, every participant in the chain must carry out its function efficiently. In addition, all of the members must coordinate with each other effectively in order to ensure value maximization. We have to face the same issues for almost all the products and services we take for granted in our everyday life, e.g., cars, hamburgers, haircuts, surgeries, movies, banks, restaurants, and you name it!&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>In this course, we want to understand fundamental principles of value creation for the consumers or the market. We try to answer questions like how the product or service is made, how the value-creating activities or functions are coordinated, who should play what leadership roles in realizing all these, and so on.

Potential applications range from aerial filming over remote visual inspection to automatic 3D reconstruction of buildings. Navigating a quadrotor manually requires a skilled pilot and constant concentration. Therefore there is a strong scientific interest to develop solutions that enable quadrotors to fly autonomously and without constant human supervision. This is a challenging research problem because the payload of a quadrotor is uttermost constrained and so both the quality of the onboard sensors and the available computing power is strongly limited. In this course we will introduce the basic concepts for autonomous navigation for quadrotors including topics such as probabilistic state estimation linear control and path planning. You will learn how to infer the position of the quadrotor from its sensor readings how to navigate along a series of waypoints and how to plan collision free trajectories. The course consists of a series of weekly lecture videos that we be interleaved by interactive quizzes and hands-on programming tasks. The programming exercises will require you to write small code snippets in Python to make a quadrotor fly in simulation.

Students are welcome to audit the course and participate in all course activities. Certificates will not be issued. Everyone experiences adversity and stress at some level whether it?s the pressure to perform in school or work relationship problems financial difficulties or simply the number of tasks to do in a short period of time. All stress isn?t bad but chronic stress can take its toll on our minds bodies and behavior. Research has shown that people can learn and use specific resilience skills (such as optimistic thinking relaxation strategies choosing one?s attention) and positive routines (good sleep scheduling in fun and so on) in order to better manage stress bounce back quicker after a setback be more effective in their academic and vocational pursuits develop stronger relationships with others be physically and mentally healthy and be satisfied with their lives overall. In short resilience is ordinary magic and can be learned. It does not necessarily mean that you have to be born resilient or get lucky in life. The purpose of this course is to teach individuals the science behind becoming a resilient person. Stated simply resilience is the ability to survive and thrive. Resiliency is not only about your ability to positively adapt in the face of adverse or challenging circumstances (that is survive) but it is also about learning the positive skills strategies and routines that enable you to live a happy fulfilling and meaningful life (in other words thrive). This course gives you the permission to take care of yourself in order to effectively manage life stressors and do what matters most in life. This captures the notion of being from the inside out which is a phrase that highlights the importance of promoting core resilience skills strategies and routines among early childhood educators. In turn resilient people are more capable of creating and maintaining nurturing supportive and effective learning environments while also optimizing their own wellbeing and love for both the big and small things in life. By the end of this course you will have learned about the knowledge and skills that you can apply in your life now and in the future to be a resilient person. Course goal: The goal for this course is to give you permission to take care of yourself and empower you to be a resilient person. A resilient person is someone who: purposely strives to be as mentally and psychically healthy as possible possesses the confidence to effectively cope with and manage stressful situations is compassionate towards self and others demonstrates grit or perseverance even in the face of adversity and focuses on the positive and fulfilling aspects of life.

Stat2.3x is the last in a sequence of three courses that make up Stat2x the online equivalent of Berkeley''s Stat 2. The focus of Stat2.3x is on statistical inference: how to make valid conclusions based on data from random samples. At the heart of the main problem addressed by the course will be a population (which you can imagine for now as a set of people) connected with which there is a numerical quantity of interest (which you can imagine for now as the average number of MOOCs the people have taken). If you could talk to each member of the population you could calculate that number exactly. But what if the population is so large that your resources will not stretch to interviewing every member? What if you can only reach a subset of the population? Stat 2.3x will discuss good ways to select the subset (yes at random); how to estimate the numerical quantity of interest based on what you see in your sample; and ways to test hypotheses about numerical or probabilistic aspects of the problem. The methods that will be covered are among the most commonly used of all statistical techniques. If you have ever read an article that claimed ''The margin of error in such surveys is about three percentage points'' or ''Researchers at the University of California at Berkeley have discovered a highly significant link between ...'' then you should expect that by the end of Stat 2.3x you will have a pretty good idea of what that means.

If you choose to join this five-week course on Behavioral Medicine you will learn about basic behavioral medicine concepts and explore how they can be applied to help people who need to change specific lifestyle behaviors to attain better health. Working with ?virtual patient scenarios? will give you a chance to test behavioral medicine interventions. You will also learn self-help tools based on behavioral medicine for whatever you need to change in your life. We?ll start the first week by looking at what makes us motivated to change our behavior. We often feel motivated for change when we experience imbalance in life. One example of a key concept that helps us understand how imbalance arises is the effort-reward model which states that ill-health is more likely to arise when there is a gap between the effort you make and how you are rewarded. To help people who are experiencing imbalance identify what they need to change we will learn about Motivational Interviewing (MI) a counseling style that stimulates behavior change. You will have an opportunity to test basic techniques in MI with a ?virtual bartender? who has sleep problems that he is trying to solve by drinking alcohol. The following four weeks will focus on coping with stress (week 2) improving sleep (week 3) increasing physical activity (week 4) and everyday behaviors (week 5) like hand washing condom use and minimizing risky alcohol use.

This course is based on a conviction that the more you know about an art the more pleasure you will find in it.', 'About this Course The Art of Poetry as the title implies approaches poetry as an art. The assumption is that as with music dance film painting and photography this art gives pleasure. And as with those arts there is a lot to know. The music you choose to hear the picture you put on your wall are likely to become more engaging the more you decide to learn about them. This course is based on a conviction that the more you know about an art the more pleasure you will find in it. And conversely pleasure is essential to understanding an art. The Art of Poetry is not a creative writing course. You will not be asked to write poems. However you will be looking very closely at elements of craft sometimes as though through the eyes of a writer. The course is demanding and based on a certain kind of intense exigent reading requiring prolonged thorough? in fact repeated? attention to specific poems. A central idea is that you as a reader say the poems aloud or at least imagine saying them aloud. The purpose is to think what it feels like to say the words of a particular poem: to imagine needing to say those exact words chosen by for example Emily Dickinson or Gerard Manley Hopkins and to reflect on that feeling. The readings for this course will include historical poems as well as contemporary work. The focus will be on elements of the art such as poetry?s historical relation to courtship; different kinds of repetition; poetry?s relation to music; the nature of greatness; techniques of sound in free verse?with only incidental attention to schools of poetry categories and trends. The Favorite Poem Project videos at favoritepoem.org provide a model for the spirit of this course. The emphasis on voice is not performative: that is as the videos demonstrate the most important voice is that of each reader saying the poem (actual or imagined) ? not necessarily the voice of the poet or a trained actor. Students are encouraged to think truly carefully and passionately about what the poem says? that is thinking about what you as a reader feel yourself saying as you give your voice to the poem.

Shakespeare is also rightly regarded as one of the greatest playwrights the world has known. This course will try to understand both Shakespeare?s popularity and his greatness by starting from a simple premise: that the fullest appreciation of Shakespeare can be achieved only when literary study is combined with analysis of the plays as theatre. Hence as we delve into the dimensions that make Shakespeare?s plays so extraordinary--from the astonishing power of their language to their uncanny capacity to illuminate so much of human life--we will also explore them in performance from Shakespeare?s own theatre to the modern screen. At the same time actors will occasionally join our effort and demonstrate ways of bringing the text alive as living theatre. Plays to be studied will include Romeo and Juliet A Midsummer Night''s Dream Much Ado About Nothing Othello King Lear and The Winter''s Tale.

In this course you will discover precisely what Borges meant.', 'About this Course Students will question for themselves the meaning of human freedom responsibility and identity by reading and responding to Dante Alighieri''s Divine Comedy. The Comedy which is richly steeped in the medieval culture of 14th century still speaks vividly to modern readers struggling with the question ?who am I?? Dante as a Florentine a poet a lover and religious believer struggled with the same question in each facet of his life before coming to a moment of vision that wholly transformed him as a person. As a 21st century reader you will encounter the poem in a novel online environment that integrates knowledge from the disciplines of literature history psychology philosophy and theology with modern technology. You will be guided through the poem by means of the ''MyDante'' Project an online environment developed by Professor Ambrosio in collaboration with the Georgetown University Center for New Designs in Learning and Scholarship (CNDLS) which will aid your own contemplative engagement with the poem. Alone and with the edX community you will reflect on both Dante''s interpretation of freedom and how it functions in the formation of personal identity and the problem of finding appropriate metaphors to discuss these issues in our modern life. You the modern reader will only understand the full implications of Dante''s poetry if you participate with it in a way that is personal and is genuinely contemplative. You will discover that contemplative reading goes beyond the literal meaning and even beyond the traditional allegorical and interpreted meaning to apply every possible meaning contained in the text to your own life and identity. Through the MyDante platform you will learn to know yourself in your own historical personal and spiritual contexts as?you journey toward a richer understanding of your freedom identity and responsibility as a person.

Where diseases were clearly understood and where treatments obviously worked on most patients such as penicillin for pneumonia there was no need to delve deeper into questions of effectiveness. But for most conditions the treatment benefits were modest and there was a need for improved ways of telling whether a new intervention was better than the previous standard treatment. And so scientists introduced a testing procedure for new treatments - the randomized controlled trial. As the cost of developing new treatments grew it became very important to detect the slightest improvement that could be attributed to the new drug in order to get it licensed and marketed. So the usual randomized trial was answering the following question: does this treatment work (for otherwise well people with just this single disease with perfect adherence treated by the best doctors under idealised conditions)? But most patients have multiple diseases imperfect adherence ordinary doctors and non-ideal circumstances. These patients want to know whether a new treatment is likely to reduce important harms for ordinary people like them receiving usual care. This mismatch meant that most trials were overestimating the real world effectiveness of new interventions. In this MOOC we are going to study this mismatch and see what its effect is on modern medical care. One example of the studies we will discuss is the VIGOR trial. This influential drug trial resulted in the widespread global overuse of this drug at a cost of wasted billions of dollars. Ironically this drug intended to reduce a problem in individuals ended up causing more of the same problem in the population! After we understand the consequences of designing the wrong kinds of trials we will also look at how best to design pragmatic randomized trials which answer the important questions that ordinary patients and decision makers in the real world most often ask. We will also explore how these can be combined with economic evaluations and qualitative research ? to answer important questions about how much these interventions cost and how they are experienced by the recipients.', 'https://www.edx.org/course/kix/kix-kipractihx-pragmatic-randomized-1541', 'N/A', '2014-06-01', 6, 'https://www.edx.org/sites/default/files/course/image/tile/kix_pragmatic_course_tile262x136.jpg', 'N/A', 'edX', 0, 'English', 'yes', ' KIx', '2014-05-02 00:00:00'),

Pre-tax subsidies which arise when energy consumers pay less than the supply cost of energy are high in many emerging and developing economies and have risen in recent years. Although pre-tax subsidies are not a large enough problem in advanced economies to cause fiscal difficulties these countries have tax subsidies where the taxes imposed on energy are not high enough to account for all of the adverse effects of excessive energy consumption including on the environment. The issue of energy subsidy reform is not new. Despite widespread recognition of their adverse consequences energy subsidies have proven difficult to reform. This course builds on an extensive cross-country analysis which is reported in the recently published IMF book on ?Energy Subsidy Reform: Lessons and Implications? to make recommendations on how to best implement reforms aimed at reducing state subsidies on energy. In the first part of the course economists from the IMF will introduce the definition and measurement of subsidies and then describe the economic social and environmental implications of subsidies. The second part of the course has two principal purposes: first to review what works best in energy subsidy reform in light of country experiences globally; and second to illustrate successes and failures in particular country contexts by summarizing some case studies.

In many parts of the world we take the availability of these services for granted. Without conscious reflection on the technological systems that bring these services to where we use them we are becoming increasingly dependent on a secure uninterrupted and affordable supply of energy water transport telecommunication and information services. They create the conditions for liveability and economic development. However today''s infrastructure systems are in a process of drastic change as they are becoming more and more web-based transnational and privatized while new technologies are on their way. The outcome of these changes is difficult to predict. In this course we will explore the challenges of infrastructure design management and governance for the future. Some of the questions that will be addressed: What are the major changes and drivers when it comes to infrastructure development? What makes infrastructure networks vulnerable and how do we manage these risks in the future? How can their reliability and quality-of-service be improved? Will they become accessible for all global citizens always and everywhere? Will they remain affordable for future generations? Will they exhaust the natural environment? Will established infrastructure systems be disrupted by technological innovations? How about security and privacy? In this course you will learn to look at these challenges from a new combined engineering and social science perspective. We will explain for example how public values are expressed in infrastructure design and how regulation dictates technology choices. It is all about dealing with complexity in the design management and governance of infrastructure. If you are interested or involved in the functioning of today''s and tomorrow''s (next generation) infrastructures this course is an exceptional learning opportunity whether you are a student or a professional. You will be interacting with peers all over the world and we will highlight a large number of case studies.

This course combines theory with practice to answer these questions.', 'About this Course You are a bank and a big part of your daily business is to lend money. Unfortunately for you lending money is definitely a risky activity: there is no 100% guarantee that you will get all your money back. For example you may expect losses in your portfolio because of the default of your counterpart. Or in a less extreme situation the credit quality of your counterpart may deteriorate according to some rating system so that your loan becomes more and more risky. These are typical situations in which credit risk manifests itself. According to the Basel Agreements credit risk is one of the three fundamental risks together with market risk and operational risk a bank (or another regulated financial institution) has to face when operating on the markets. As the 2008 financial crisis has shown us a correct understanding of credit risk and the ability to cope with it are fundamental in the world of today. The aim of this course is to provide an introduction to credit risk modeling and hedging. At the end of the course the students will be able to understand and correctly use the basic tools of credit risk management both from a theoretical and most of all a practical point of view. This will be a quite unconventional course. For every methodology we will analyze its points of strengths but we will also stress its points of weakness.

Stat2.2x is the second of three five-week courses that make up Stat2x the online equivalent of Berkeley''s Stat 2. The focus of Stat2.2x is on probability theory: exactly what is a random sample and how does randomness work? If you buy 10 lottery tickets instead of 1 does your chance of winning go up by a factor of 10? What is the law of averages? How can polls make accurate predictions based on data from small fractions of the population? What should you expect to happen ''just by chance''? These are some of the questions we will address in the course. We will start with exact calculations of chances when the experiments are small enough that exact calculations are feasible and interesting. Then we will step back from all the details and try to identify features of large random samples that will help us approximate probabilities that are hard to compute exactly. We will study sums and averages of large random samples discuss the factors that affect their accuracy and use the normal approximation for their probability distributions.

Innovating in Health Care (IHC) enables participants to meet and interact with others who are also interested in improving health care. The course focuses on evaluating and crafting business models that attain alignment between an entrepreneurial health care venture and the six factors that critically shape new health care ventures - Financing Structure Public Policy Consumers Technology and Accountability. Innovating in Health Care discusses the impact of these factors on business models for three different kinds of innovations: consumer-focused technology-driven and integrations which create scale. You will learn: How to distinguish successful innovations from those likely to fail How to determine if an innovation is aligned with its environment Which elements make up a viable competitive strategy for an innovative health care venture How other elements combine to create a feasible business model for an innovative health care venture How to create a business plan The course is conducted through lectures about assessing and creating a business plan and with case studies that describe decisions facing real entrepreneurial health firms and requires you to analyze these potential decisions through the IHC framework. Participants are taught how to use the case method and how to evaluate business plans. In addition these lessons are highlighted by insights from the top global health care innovators.

We will look at some perennial philosophical problems: Is there a God? What is knowledge and how do we get it? What is the place of our consciousness in the physical world? Do we have free will? How do we persist over time as our bodily and psychological traits change? The second goal is to get you thinking philosophically yourself.

COURSE OVERVIEW Iran?s nuclear ambitions the slaughter in Syria?s civil war WikiLeaks and the publication of classified information ? these are among the challenges American national security students in 211x will wrestle with this year.? This introduction is based on one of the most popular and dynamic courses taught at Harvard''s Kennedy School of Government. In each case students are cast as a trusted NSC staffer to President Obama or to another principal in the policy-making process.? Each case requires not only reexamining current U.S. strategy but also?identifying alternative strategies for protecting and advancing national interests. In each of these cases which include a special two-week segment on the disclosures surrounding NSA surveillance and the trove of WikiLeaks documents of previously-secret American policymaking participants have to operate in the rough-and-tumble of a government whose deliberations are discombobulated by leaks reports about internal differences among policymakers and press analyses. Weekly assignments require strategic thinking: analyzing dynamics of challenges and developing strategies for addressing them.? Students learn to summarize their analyses in a succinct??Strategic Options Memo? that combines careful analysis and strategic imagination on the one hand with the necessity to communicate to major constituencies in order to sustain public support on the other. They also examine how policymaking is affected by constant public analysis of government deliberations.', 'https://www.edx.org/course/harvardx/harvardx-hks211-1x-central-challenges-1087', 'http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQKsju_u9_0', '2013-10-01', 8, 'https://www.edx.org/sites/default/files/course/image/tile/hks211x_course_tile262x136.jpg', 'N/A', 'edX', 0, 'English', 'yes', ' HarvardX', '2014-05-02 00:00:00'),

That past can be directly observed through the study of the human fossil record the materials preserved for archaeological study and the DNA of living and extinct human populations. This course will provide an overview of human evolutionary history from the present--contemporary human variation in a comparative context--through our last common ancestor with the living great apes some 5-7 million years in the past. Emphasis will be placed on major evolutionary changes in the development of humans and the methodological approaches used by paleoanthropologists and related investigators to develop that knowledge. The course will begin by asking basic questions about how evolution operates to shape biological variation and what patterns of variation look like in living humans and apes. We will then look at how the human lineage first began to differentiate from apes the rise and fall of the Australopithecines the origin and dispersal of the genus Homo and eventually the radical evolutionary changes associated with the development of agricultural practices in the past 15000 years. Throughout the course students will be exposed to the primary data places and theories that shape our understanding of human evolution.

This course will examine architecture through time beginning with First Societies and extending to the 15th century. Though the course is chronological it is not intended as a linear narrative but rather aims to provide a more global view by focusing on different architectural ''moments.'' The lectures will give students the appropriate grounding for understanding a range of buildings and contexts. The material in the lectures will be supplemented by readings from the textbook A Global History of Architecture. Each lecture analyzes a particular architectural transformation arising from a dynamic cultural situation. How did the introduction of iron in the ninth century BCE impact regional politics and the development of architecture? How did new religious formations such as Buddhism and Hinduism produce new architectural understandings? What were the architectural consequences of the changing political landscape in northern Italy in the 14th century? How did rock-cut architecture move across space and time from West Asia to India to Africa? How did the emergence of corn impact the rise of religious and temple construction in Mexico?

There will be an emphasis on water quality and the functionality of each unit process within the treatment chain.? After the course one should be able to recognise the process units describe their function and make simple design calculations on water treatment? plants (drinking and waste water).? Overall the course will teach the role of treatment technologies in providing adequate water supply and effective sanitation which are essential for human society and the safeguarding of public and environmental health. There is a global trend towards urbanisation with over 50% of humanity currently residing in urban areas. Water is invariably linked to urban functionality as industrial domestic and agricultural use. Essential services such as drinking water supply sanitation and wastewater treatment to protect surface water and groundwater resources need to be present in such environment. The provision of these essential urban water services present real challenges in many parts of the world today. Accessible fresh water resources suitable for drinking water and other ecosystem services is approximated to be 200000 km3 approximately 0.3% of the total freshwater resources and less than 0.01% of the total water on earth. These accessible freshwater resources are not equally distributed and many countries today are experiencing water scarcity which in turn affects community health and in many places water scarcity is the inhibiting factor for economic growth. This highlights the importance of conserving and protecting the accessible freshwater resources through the implementation of adequate treatment technologies combined with a robust infrastructure. Through utilising relevant treatment technologies to upgrade water to a quality suitable for subsequent use or discharge with more and more stringent effluent demands the urban water chain has the possibility to transform to an urban water cycle and improve interactions within the greater hydrological cycle.

Since the book is a record of things you will soon forget Professor Lewin recommends you buy the book if you can afford it. ABOUT THE LECTURES Lewin''s lectures at MIT are legendary. Many have been shown for over six years (starting in 1995) on UWTV in Seattle reaching an audience of about four million people. For fifteen years (starting in 1983) he was on MIT Cable TV helping freshmen with their weekly homework assignments. His programs were aired 24 hours per day and were frequently watched by upper-class students. Additionally his 35 lectures on Newtonian Mechanics 36 lectures on Electricity and Magnetism and 23 lectures on Vibrations and Waves can also be viewed at MIT''S OpenCourseWare iTunes U YouTube and Academic Earth. About 5000 people daily from all over the world watch these lectures - that''s about two million people per year! Many teachers show them regularly in their classrooms.

Make sure to check for reruns of this course. What is it to be human and how can ancient concepts of the heroic and anti-heroic inform our understanding of the human condition? That question is at the core of The Ancient Greek Hero which introduces (or reintroduces) students to the great texts of classical Greek culture by focusing on concepts of the Hero in an engaging highly comparative way. The classical Greeks'' concepts of Heroes and the ''heroic'' were very different from the way we understand the term today. In this course students analyze Greek heroes and anti-heroes in their own historical contexts in order to gain an understanding of these concepts as they were originally understood while also learning how they can inform our understanding of the human condition in general. In Greek tradition a hero was a human male or female of the remote past who was endowed with superhuman abilities by virtue of being descended from an immortal god. Rather than being paragons of virtue as heroes are viewed in many modern cultures ancient Greek heroes had all of the qualities and faults of their fellow humans but on a much larger scale. Further despite their mortality heroes like the gods were objects of cult worship ? a dimension which is also explored in depth in the course. The original sources studied in this course include the Homeric Iliad and Odyssey; tragedies of Aeschylus Sophocles and Euripides; songs of Sappho and Pindar; dialogues of Plato; historical texts of Herodotus; and more including the intriguing but rarely studied dialogue ''On Heroes'' by Philostratus. All works are presented in English translation with attention to the subtleties of the original Greek. These original sources are frequently supplemented both by ancient art and by modern comparanda including opera and cinema (from Jacques Offenbach''s opera Tales of Hoffman to Ridley Scott''s science fiction classic Blade Runner). The true hero of the course is the logos (''word'') of reasoned expression as activated by Socratic dialogue. The logos of dialogue requires both careful thought and close (or ''slow'') reading which is a core skill taught in this class. The course begins by considering the heroes of Homer''s epics and ends with Plato''s memories of the final days of Socrates -- memories which can only be fully understood by a reader who has gained a thorough comprehension of the ancient Greek hero in all his or her various manifestations. Using modern technology and engaging texts The Ancient Greek Hero provides students who have no previous background in classical Greek civilization with a fully engaging and immediately accessible introduction to the most beautiful moments in this ancient literature its myths and its ritual practices.

Stat2.3x is the last in a sequence of three courses that make up Stat2x the online equivalent of Berkeley''s Stat 2. The focus of Stat2.3x is on statistical inference: how to make valid conclusions based on data from random samples. At the heart of the main problem addressed by the course will be a population (which you can imagine for now as a set of people) connected with which there is a numerical quantity of interest (which you can imagine for now as the average number of MOOCs the people have taken). If?you could talk to each member of the population you could calculate that number exactly. But what if the population is so large that your resources will not stretch to interviewing every member? What if you can only reach a subset of the population? ? Stat 2.3x will discuss good ways to select the subset (yes at random); how to estimate the numerical quantity of interest based on what you see in your sample; and ways to test hypotheses about numerical or probabilistic aspects of the problem. ? The methods that will be covered are among the most commonly used of all statistical techniques. If you have ever read an article that claimed ''The margin of error in such surveys is about three percentage points'' or ''Researchers at the University of California at Berkeley have discovered a highly significant link between ...'' then you should expect that by the end of Stat 2.3x you will have a pretty good idea of what that?means. Examples will range all the way from a little girl''s school science project (seriously ? she did a great job and her results were published in a major journal) to rulings by the U.S. Supreme Court. ? The fundamental approach of the series was provided in the description of Stat2.1x and appears here again: There will be no mindless memorization of formulas and methods.

It will give you a unified overview of mechanics that will dramatically increase your problem-solving ability. It is open to any students who meet the prerequisites (see right) but is especially designed for teachers and those who want to improve their existing understanding of mechanics. Newtonian mechanics is the study of how forces change the motion of objects. This course begins with force and moves on to straight-line motion momentum mechanical energy rotational motion and angular momentum. Optional units include oscillations planetary orbits and a review of multi-concept problems. Why Take Our Course? Our approach to mechanics is a unique one. Through worked examples and online texts we introduce a strategic overview of core concepts in mechanics. This overview couples with a new approach to problem-solving that will help you break down and solve multi-concept problems. By choosing a system of objects defining their interactions and deciding on a model to use to describe them you will come to solve physics problems more easily and more systematically. The road to ''easy'' goes through ''hard.'' This course is more challenging than a standard high school or introductory college physics offering. We will help you become a more expert problem solver and that process involves solving a variety of problems in many different ways with our new approach. The reward is stronger problem-solving ability that carries over to other areas in physics. Take this course to better organize your mechanics knowledge to prepare for AP or advanced standing exams to teach more effectively or if you enjoy attacking challenging problems! For Teachers If you are a teacher looking to improve your knowledge of mechanics or to learn new approaches to teach your students we encourage you to sign up. Our approach has been researched carefully and has proven effectiveness when it comes to preparing students for later courses.

The material is catered to participants in organizations of all sizes including entrepreneurs managers in corporations and startups and policymakers. Our premise is that management is a discipline that can be learned from study and that a diverse set of academic research has practical and actionable implications for how to manage in a modern organization. The lecture material is based on our book Unlocking the Ivory Tower: How Management Research Can Transform Your Business.  Workload 6-8 hours per week.

Syllabus:   Week 1: Strategy   Strategy is the long-term direction and scope of an organization as that organization pursues advantage through its configuration of resources to meet the needs of markets and to fulfill stakeholder expectations (Johnson and Scholes 2006). Corporate strategy addresses which business a corporation will participate in and business strategy focuses on how a particular business competes within its industry.   Week 2: Entrepreneurship   Shane and Venkataraman (2000 p. 218) define the academic field of entrepreneurship as the ?scholarly examination of how by whom and with what effects opportunities to create future goods and services are discovered evaluated and exploited.? Why do some people and not others discover and exploit the opportunities that are the heart of entrepreneurship?   Week 3: Leadership   Leadership is a process whereby an individual influences a group of individuals to achieve a common goal. We look at competing views of what leaders should do what they actually do how leaders establish organizational culture and what are the elements of constructive leadership.   Week 4: Organization and Processes   Organizational design is the alignment of structure process rewards metrics and talent with the strategy of the business. In this chapter we describe what has (and has not) been established to promote organizational effectiveness.   Week 5: International Business   All companies?even new companies in new industries?must consider the global environment in which they operate. Key international business literature addresses dimensions such as theories of multinational enterprises international political economy multinational management and culture. These dimensions provide managers with tools and concepts needed for growing beyond national borders.   Week 6: Innovation   Contexts for innovation vary based on location industry and country. We look here at how innovation diffuses or spreads and thus how current technology such as the web and social media might affect the adoption of innovative outputs. It is essential that managers understand the contexts for innovation at the firm industry and country levels in creating and managing innovation strategies.   Week 7: Finance   Finance is the study of how investors allocate their assets over time under conditions of certainty and uncertainty and typically examines the relationship between money time and risk.

The language produced by your students whether that language is in oral or written form constitutes a key piece of evidence. This course is intended for school-based instructional coaches and leaders who support teachers. It will help coaches and instructional leaders to work collaboratively with teachers to make systematic observations of student oral and written language in their classrooms. This is a lab course in the sense that the learning will come from gathering systematic evidence analyzing it and sharing it with your peers in the course. Through the lab course participants will have the opportunity to collect and explore four major components of formative assessment practice: clarifying intended learning eliciting evidence interpreting evidence and acting on evidence. This course will connect formative assessment practice to the key language practices that undergird the Common Core State Standards and Next Generation Science Standards. These new standards in particular emphasize high quality student-to-student discourse engaging with the reasoning of others and writing with claims and evidence. The course will consist of three sessions: (1) introductory materials on formative assessment and an assignment to collect student language (2) self and peer analysis of the language sample in small teams and (3) collaborative reflection and synthesis of the analyses. ? The teacher-coaches and school leaders who participate in this course also will be helping the Stanford team to develop a more elaborate set of courses on formative assessment practice to be offered next Fall (2014). Those course will be geared directly for teachers with optional participation of their coaches. The samples collected in this lab course will become real-life illustrative examples for those courses and we will also be inviting the teacher-coaches and school instructional leaders taking the current MOOC to enroll their teachers in the fall course to develop their expertise in formative assessment as it relates to the CCSS.

The new standards specifically describe the...', 'The Common Core State Standards for English ELA and Mathematics emphasize improving the quality of student-to-student discourse as a major feature of instruction. The new standards specifically describe the importance of students understanding the reasoning of others and engaging in meaningful conversations using evidence for claims. Yet this type of student-to-student discourse tends to be rare in classrooms. Common classroom activities such as whole class discussions jigsaws and think-pair-shares can have the appearance of constructive interactions but they often do not provide adequate opportunities for all students to engage in academically rich back-and-forth dialogs. This short course looks closely at student-to-student discourse and addresses how to facilitate student engagement in the types of interactions required by the new standards. It organizes a massive collaboration of educators who wish to support students particularly English Language Learners to co-create and build upon each other?s ideas as they interact with the content. Starting with the notion that in order to improve the quality of student discourse educators need to listen closely to existing talk the course asks participants to gather analyze and share examples of student conversations from their classrooms. The overall goal is for participating educators to better understand student-student classroom discourse and use what they learn to facilitate higher quality interactions that build disciplinary knowledge and skills. The four main objectives of this course are for participants to:   Prerequisites   In order to participate in the course you will need to have access to a classroom in which you or the teacher you are observing are able to collect short samples of paired student talk two different times.   Frequently Asked Questions   Will I get a Statement of Accomplishment? This course may be taken for a free statement of accomplishment.   How much of the time commitment will this course be? Online work will take around 1 hour per week; assignments will take around 1 hour per week.   Any additional textbooks or software required? No.   Syllabus   Weeks 1-2: Constructive Conversations I   In these two weeks we dive into what high-quality talk between students can sound like in lessons that effectively teach the new standards. Specifically we focus on the features of ?constructive interactions? during which students create clarify support and negotiate ideas as they talk about concepts and build understandings in a discipline.   Weeks 3-4: Teaching the Constructive Conversation Skills   These two weeks focus on instruction to support rich interaction introduced in Module 1. We analyze video clips that show teaching that fosters interaction skills described in the new standards. We look at activities that help students build interactions skills for staying focused on objectives building and negotiating ideas and clarifying ideas.   Weeks 5-6: Constructive Conversations II   These two weeks we will look more in depth at how to foster student interactions that build the learning of lesson objectives challenge thinking and push students to use more complex language of the Common Core standards.   Week 7: Collaboration Communication and Community   This will be a summative week when we will pull together everything we?ve covered in the course to create a product that communicates to other teachers the value of having a discourse focus for implementing the new standards. You will also consider next steps for applying and collaborating in this work during the year.
